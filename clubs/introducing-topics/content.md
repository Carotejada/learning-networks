# Creative methods of introducing topics

There are times in your club event when you might want to softly introduce a topic to your crowd before doing an activity, like a little icebreaker or tiny activity to get your learners excited about it. This guide provides ways to introducing topics and creating segueways from one activity to another. With the ice breakers techniques shown here, your club will ramp up their energy before the actual activity starts. You can pick and choose which methods you like best, and remix the formats to suit your clubs needs.

## Micro-activities
A micro-activity: is an activity that helps support and introduce a more involved activity. Micro-activities should be simple, quick and easy to execute. For example:

* Distribute post-it notes and markers to all people present at the club event including learners, facilitators, CCs.
* Ask a question or make a call for opinions
* Everyone writes one statement per sticky note, anonymously, and then they walk to a flip chart or wall and place their note on it at random positions. It is important that they feel that this is anonymous, as that will create a willingness to write their true opinion instead of what they might think others want to hear.
* Have everyone do a gallery walk, placing “+1” signs in notes they agree with.

Micro-activities can be remixed to have specific zones in the flipchart for a more structured final chart such as when asking them “Why do you like or doesn’t like avocado in your sandwich?” and you have a zone marked with “like” and another with “doesn’t like” and the learners place their sticky notes on each zone depending on where there reasoning lies.

## Starting with RFC

Request For Comments (RFC) is a type of micro-activity in which you pose a question to learners and invite them to comment. For example, suppose you want to do an activity about the dangers to one’s privacy when using mobile apps. You can start by asking them “What mobile apps you use the most?” and then based on their answers and +1s, you can move into a deeper discussion and activities focused on the popular apps.

## Dreaming with a blue sky question

A blue sky question is not tied to reality or even feasibility. For example, “If you were a migrating bird, where would you migrate to?”is a great blue sky questions. This question can be followed by [a poster making activity in Mozilla Thimble](https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/andregarzia/12789/) focusing on the places they’d like to migrate. With blue sky questions, the goal is to expand their minds with broad, open questions so that they use their answers to propel the activity. After all, an important aspect of clubbing is being creative! 

## Finding common ground with flipchart columns
Divide your wall or flip-chart into sections or columns. Each space is reserved for an opinion on a given topic Using the natural division between opinions, form groups to do the main activity. 

Example: divide the space into two sections called “I Want To Believe”, and “No, that is not true!” And ask your learners, “who believe in Aliens?” Use the natural formed groups to do a remixed version of Kraken The Code focused on Aliens!

## Celebrating with reflections
After the club has been established for some time and the learners have accumulated experiences together, ask question such as: “What was the most fun moment you had in this club?” Or “When have you used your new digital skills outside of the club?” Proceed with an activity like [“Story of Us”](http://mozilla.github.io/mozilla-club-activity-story-of-us/). Use these moments to reflect on your club’s progress and shared stories. Remember to share them back with the larger club ecosystem.
