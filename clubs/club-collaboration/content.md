This Mozilla Club guide was created by [Mozilla Clubs](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/clubs/) staff and Mozilla Club Captain Steven Van Sant ([Mozilla Club Omaha](https://www.facebook.com/mozillaOmaha/)) If you have an idea for a guide and/or would like to help author one of your own please [let us know](https://forum.learning.mozilla.org/t/suggestions-for-new-clubs-guides/970/1). 

##Welcome

This is a Mozilla Club guide about best practices for communicating and collaborating between clubs and club participants.

Thousands of people around the world participate in Mozilla Clubs as Regional Coordinators, Club Captains and learners. Take a look at our [interactive map](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/clubs) to see the full list. 

We encourage club leaders to engage with each other and leverage each other's expertise. There are several different channels and methods for club participants to connect. Each has it’s own benefits and challenges. We hope that the information outlined below helps everyone connect productively and successfully.

##Communication Channels

There are many ways to communicate on the web and each Mozilla Club utilizes their preferred method, which creates a dynamic and evolving landscape. 

Since Mozilla Clubs are diverse it’s good to make sure you do some research before contacting other clubs. By doing this, you can avoid a variety of challenges such as:

1. Time Zone Conflicts (Be conscious of the varied time zones club leaders are in and be considerate when planning times to chat or message each other)
2. Language Barriers (Be sensitive to language barriers that may exist between club participants and exercise patience and clarity when communicating to people that do not speak your language)
3. Technology Barriers (Be aware that everyone has a different level of experience with technology and that may impact what they make, do or engage with in their club. It is best to leverage these differences and share knowledge in any way possible)

It’s also equally important to remember a few basic practices:

1. Be clear about how you prefer to converse with someone and be specific with your inquiries so everyone is clear and knows how to contribute to the conversation.
2. Ask each other what platforms of communication are preferred (i.e. facebook, telegram, skype, google hangout, etc.)
3. Share your own knowledge of social networking and collaborating, remember we all have different experiences to draw from.
4. Always be respectful and aware of other people's needs.
5. Be flexible and understanding of time constraints and availability. 
6. Plan your collaboration by listing the goals, tools, and other important information that will make your event successful.

Once you’ve researched and learned about the club you would like to contact figure out how you will introduce yourself and be clear about what club related activities you are reaching out for. It helps to point out something you find inspiring or exciting about their work. Possible reasons you may want to reach out to other clubs are:

* They are geographically close to you and you would like to collaborate.
* They are doing something you want to learn more about.
* You are looking for peer assistance. 
* You want to give positive feedback about something they did.
* You have a clubs related question you think they can help answer.

##Collaborating with other Clubs

Many clubs benefit from collaboration by hearing new perspectives, getting peer assistance, receiving mentorship and more. They may collaborate in-person or virtually. They have the option to use whatever platform or format for collaboration that best suites their needs. 

There are many important factors to think about when setting up and planning your cross-club collaboration event. Planning and setting up your spaces appropriately can become more time consuming than the actual collaboration event. As a general rule you can probably spend up to 4 hours or more planning a 1 hour collaboration event. Below are some helpful tools and tips to remember when planning your event.

Some common collaboration and communication tools are:

1. [Github](http://github.com/) is an open source collaboration tool that clubs use to share code, teaching resources, curriculum and more. **Example:** [Mozilla Clubs Github repository](https://github.com/mozilla/learning-networks/tree/gh-pages/clubs) 
2. [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) a free, web-based word processor offered by Google that clubs use to collaboratively edit documents and work on projects together. **Example:** [Spanish translation of Web Literacy Map](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15CJ0Tt6muh1zZPRYbqb_GXIL48MNjRvO__A54BQ8qZ0/edit?usp=sharing) 
3. [Mozilla Learning Forum](https://forum.learning.mozilla.org/c/mozilla-clubs) is a free online discussion forum that clubs use to pitch ideas, get feedback on projects, share work and make announcements. **Example:** [Suggestions for new guides and resources](https://forum.learning.mozilla.org/t/suggestions-for-new-clubs-guides/970/16)
4. [RedPen](https://redpen.io/) is a Web app to collaboratively comment on a file and clubs use it get feedback from each other. **Example:** [Re-design of Mozilla Clubs page](https://redpen.io/p/rb14e4c0eb3594f430)
5. [Slack](https://slack.com/is) is a real-time messaging, archiving and team building app that clubs use to collaborate on projects, across teams and with each other. **Example:** [Hive NYC Slack Channel](https://hivenyc.slack.com/messages/general-chat/)
6. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mozillaclubs/) is a social networking web application that clubs utilize to chat, post events, share content, raise awareness, and grow their networks. **Example:** [Mozilla Clubs Cagliari Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/MozillaCagliariClub/)
7. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MozLearn) is a social network that clubs use to to start campaigns, share work, find resources and share their opinions. **Example:** [Mozilla Club Rio on Twitter](https://twitter.com/riomozillaclub)
8. [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/) is a digital voice calling application complete with video features that many clubs use to contact other clubs or club members. 
9. [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) is a cloud-based instant messaging service and is used among club participants to communicate individually and/or in groups. 
10. [Whats App](https://www.whatsapp.com/) is an instant messaging application for smartphones that clubs use to communicate with members and other clubs. **Example:** [Mozilla Clubs for women and girls in Nairobi](https://thimbleprojects.org/amira/66191/) share updates through a closed Whats app group
11. [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/) is a communication platform developed by Google and allows clubs to video chat, message, or voice chat digitally from a computer.

A collaborative environment is representative of a Mozilla Club and its ability to gain synergy as a group on the web, each of the above web apps and sites are all useful in some respect but you should be flexible when working with others. Your ability to change is often times the big factor on having successful collaborations.

Facebook is a great way to connect with fellow club members and here are some [tips](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xIVDfARZDgQhBkp8BGKs1KqfjCrEXrW5RLetT5Ki3Ws/edit?usp=sharing) about how to set up a page to use for your club.
