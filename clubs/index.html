              <p>
                  Education today is stagnating and does not prepare young people for the future. We are not doing enough to teach digital skills and web literacy.
              </p>
              <p>
                  We live in a world shaped by the culture and technology of the Web. We participate in a global economy that is increasingly in need of jobs that leverage digital skills. Society needs people who think critically, collaborate with one another and grow and thrive in their digital lives.  
              </p>
              <p>
                  There are 2.3 billion internet users today, and another billion coming online soon. It is critical that everyone knows how to read, write and participate in the digital world.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Web literacy combined with critical thinking, collaboration, and resilience are as fundamental today as being able to read and write.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Will you join us to teach digital skills and web literacy?
              </p>              
            
            <h2 id="whymozilla">Why Mozilla</h2>
            
              <p>
                  Mozilla is dedicated to protecting the Web as a global public resource that promotes openness, innovation and opportunity for all. This Web is as important to education as it is to economy, culture and society.
              </p>  
              <p>
                  Mozilla, together with partners and collaborators, are transforming education and empowering young people with an approach called connected learning.
              </p>  
               <p>
                  Connected learning is based on research that people learn best if they can combine their personal passions with rigorous academic scaffolding and to make projects with friends, peers and educators.
              </p>               
               <p>
                  Open networks like the internet—and the ability for people to understand and wield these networks—make this learning possible. Mozilla applies connected learning in programs such as Hive Learning Networks, Maker Party and Webmaker.
              </p>  
              <p>
                  We have now unified these efforts in education into the Mozilla Learning Network. We serve our mission by teaching digital skills in local communities through hands-on learning and making. We guide learners to think critically about what they read on the Web, to remix and write their own digital content, and to improve their lives and communities through their participation online. 
              </p>                
              <p>
                  Our goal is to help people become critical consumers, contributors and participants on the Web. Together, if we rise to the challenge of spreading web literacy, we can help the Web remain open, accessible and a resource for everyone. 
              </p>                 

            <h2 id="#whymozillaclubs">Why Mozilla Clubs</h2>
              <p>
                  To make an impact teaching digital skills and web literacy, we developed the Mozilla Clubs program.
              </p>  
               <p>
                  Mozilla Clubs offer a unique and sustainable way to teach the Web in local communities. We designed them with these key elements:
              <ul>
                               <li><b>Connected learning in action.</b> Research shows you learn best when you learn by making projects you care about, with peers who support and encourage you. That’s why our program is hands-on, production-centered and social. Learners gain confidence with the Web by actively shaping it together.</li>
                               <li><b>Curriculum that’s free & open and educator-tested.</b> Our curriculum features hands-on ways to teach the Web, free of cost and free to reuse and remix. It’s been created and curated by top educators in schools, afterschool programs, libraries and community centers around the globe. Each activity includes step-by-step instructions and tips for how to teach it. Whether learning how to code, understanding why privacy matters, or creating openly-licensed web content, we believe teaching the web should be fun and engaging. Furthermore, many activities can also be taught with limited to no connectivity, ensuring the Web can be learned anywhere and by anyone. The learning objectives underpinning each activity are informed by Mozilla's Web Literacy Map.</li>
                  <li><b>Best practices and community mentorship. </b> Clubs are key nodes in the Mozilla Learning Network, which enables connections to other people teaching digital literacy. By connecting with others, individual Mozilla club nodes have access to best practices and mentorship around the world. Local clubs are more resilient and effective when they are networked with each other.</li>
                  <li><b>Regular engagement.</b> Literacy doesn’t happen overnight. Learning takes time and application of both theory and practice. Through regular meetings, both learners and club captains grow and improve. This deepens peer learning within the local community and with each other. </li>
              </ul>
              </p>               
            
            <h2 id="#whatmozillaclub">What is a Mozilla Club</h2>
            
            <p>
                A group of learners guided by a club captain who together meet regularly to read, write and participate on the Web by making projects they care about, supported by a shared set of curricula. Mozilla Clubs is a program to teach digital skills and web literacy. It focuses on regular, in-person learning tailored to the needs and opportunities of local communities. It harnesses the Web as a unique public resource to learn and grow.

                      <li>Meet regularly in-person</li>
                      <li>Develop its learners’ digital skills and leadership in an inclusive, participatory way.</li>

        <h3>1. Partner Criteria</h3>
        
        <p>
                We've used "partnerships" in a very broad way in the past. Going forward, we want to be more specific about what a partner is, so we can better find and serve them, and so we can give our close partners the level of attention they need. <b>We would rather have fewer, more strategic and sustaining partnerships, than many light uninvolved ones.</b>  
        </p>
        
        
            <div class="well" id="silos">
              <ul>
                <li><i>A partner is eligible if they:</i></li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>have local nodes in 2+ cities</li>
                      <li>already have Regional Coordinators, or are committed to finding and sustaining them</li>
                      <li>are interested in our curriculum, organizing model or training</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li><i>Mozilla can deliver:</i>
                  <ul>
                      <li>on-boarding and continued support to the partner's Regional Coordinators</li>
                      <li>an organizing model</li>
                      <li>existing curriculum</li>
                  </ul>
                      </li>
                  <li><i>The partnership is closed when:</i>
                  <ul>
                      <li>the partner commits to fulfilling the Regional Coordinator role</li>
                      <li>a Mozilla staff organizer has met and confirmed the terms with the Regional Coordinator</li>
                      <li>under exceptional circustances, like notable funding or reach, any curriculum or organizing model adaptions have been scoped and agreed upon by the partner and the Mozilla staff organizer.</li>
                  </ul>
                      </li>

        <h3>Maker Party</h3>
        
        <p>
        Campaigning is a powerful way to organize peaks and valleys for the community. This year, the Maker Party will evolve in the following important ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Asynchronous, instead of synchronous. </b>Spread throughout the year, instead of just two / three months.</li>
            <li><b>Super-localized. </b>Developing deep knowledge, partnerships, product learning, etc. e.g., When’re we’re focused on Brazil, we’re *really* focused on Brazil</li>
            <li><b>Focused where we have heat.</b> Our current base + key countries for 2015. </li>
            <li><b>Tightly integrated w. partner sales</b>Work even more closely w. partnerships / sales. </li>
            <li><b>Marketing supported</b>...</li>
            <li><b>Support and coordination with directed, niche marketing.</b> Trying to broader MoFo and Mozilla-wide efforts wherever possible.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            The emphasis for the Learning Network team is on leadership and organizing structure. Not just sustained activity, but also volunteers growing, getting better and more impactful -- and getting more responsibility as a result, building a larger-scale system by managing other volunteers, etc.
