            <h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
              <p>
                  The Web is where our personal, civic, and economic lives connect. Knowing how to wield the Web is essential to success today.   
              </p>
              <p>
                  There are 2.3 billion internet users today, and another billion coming online soon. It is critical that <b>everyone knows how to read, write and participate</b> in the digital world.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Will you join us to teach digital skills and strive for <b>universal web literacy?</b>
              </p>              
            
            <h2 id="whymozilla">Why Mozilla</h2>
            
              <p>
                  <b>Mozilla is dedicated to protecting the Web as a global public resource that promotes openness, innovation and opportunity for all.</b> This Web is as important to education as it is to economy, culture and society.
              </p>  
              <p>
                  Mozilla, together with partners and collaborators, are <b>striving for universal web literacy</b> with an approach called <b>connected learning.</b>
              </p>  
               <p>
                  Connected learning is based on research that people learn best if they can combine their personal passions with rigorous academic scaffolding and to make projects with friends, peers and educators. <b>Open networks make this learning possible.</b>
              </p>  
              <p>
                  We have unified our efforts in education into the <b><a href="https://teach.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Learning Network.</a></b> We serve our mission by teaching digital skills in local communities through <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.webmaker.org%2Flearning-through-making-the-best-kind-of-education&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFN3vFtjRtk6YMUhVwd7pNShC5Awg">hands-on learning and making.</a> We guide learners to think critically about what they read on the Web, to remix and write their own digital content, and to improve their lives and communities through their participation online. 
              </p>                
              <p>
                  <b>Our goal is to help people become critical consumers, contributors and participants on the Web.</b> If people experience the web as critical to their learning, work and social lives they will <b>better understand their role in helping the Web remain open, accessible and a resource for all.</b> 
              </p>                 

            <h2 id="whymozillaclubs">Why Mozilla Clubs</h2> 
               <p>
                  Mozilla Clubs offer a unique and sustainable way to teach the Web in local communities. We designed this program with these key elements:
              <ul>
                  <li><b>Connected learning in action.</b> Research shows you learn best when you learn by making projects you care about, with peers who support and encourage you. That’s why our program is hands-on, production-centered and social. Learners gain confidence with the Web by actively shaping it together.</li>
                  <li><b>Curriculum that’s free & open and educator-tested.</b> Our curriculum features hands-on ways to teach the Web, free of cost and free to reuse and remix. It’s been created and curated by top educators in schools, afterschool programs, libraries and community centers around the globe. Each activity includes step-by-step instructions and tips for how to teach it. Whether learning how to code, understanding why privacy matters, or creating openly-licensed web content, we believe teaching the web should be fun and engaging. Furthermore, many activities can also be taught with limited to no connectivity, ensuring the Web can be learned anywhere and by anyone. The learning objectives underpinning each activity are informed by Mozilla's Web Literacy Map.</li>
                  <li><b>Best practices and community mentorship. </b> Clubs are key nodes in the Mozilla Learning Network, which enables connections to other people teaching digital literacy. By connecting with others, individual Mozilla club nodes have access to best practices and mentorship around the world. Local clubs are more resilient and effective when they are networked with each other.</li>
                  <li><b>Regular engagement.</b> Literacy doesn’t happen overnight. Learning takes time and application of both theory and practice. Through regular meetings, both learners and club captains grow and improve. This deepens peer learning within the local community and with each other. </li>
              </ul>
              </p>
