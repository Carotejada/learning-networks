              <p>
                  Education today is stagnating and does not prepare young people for the future. We are not doing enough to teach digital skills and web literacy.
              </p>
              <p>
                  We live in a world shaped by the culture and technology of the Web. We participate in a global economy that is increasingly in need of jobs that leverage digital skills. Society needs people who think critically, collaborate with one another and grow and thrive in their digital lives.  
              </p>
              <p>
                  There are 2.3 billion internet users today, and another billion coming online soon. It is critical that everyone knows how to read, write and participate in the digital world.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Web literacy combined with critical thinking, collaboration, and resilience are as fundamental today as being able to read and write.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Will you join us to teach digital skills and web literacy?
              </p>              
            
            <h2 id="whymozilla">Why Mozilla</h2>
            
              <p>
                  Mozilla is dedicated to protecting the Web as a global public resource that promotes openness, innovation and opportunity for all. This Web is as important to education as it is to economy, culture and society.
              </p>  
              <p>
                  Mozilla, together with partners and collaborators, are transforming education and empowering young people with an approach called connected learning.
              </p>  
               <p>
                  Connected learning is based on research that people learn best if they can combine their personal passions with rigorous academic scaffolding and to make projects with friends, peers and educators.
              </p>               
               <p>
                  Open networks like the internet—and the ability for people to understand and wield these networks—make this learning possible. Mozilla applies connected learning in programs such as Hive Learning Networks, Maker Party and Webmaker.
              </p>  
              <p>
                  We have now unified these efforts in education into the Mozilla Learning Network. We serve our mission by teaching digital skills in local communities through hands-on learning and making. We guide learners to think critically about what they read on the Web, to remix and write their own digital content, and to improve their lives and communities through their participation online. 
              </p>                
              <p>
                  Our goal is to help people become critical consumers, contributors and participants on the Web. Together, if we rise to the challenge of spreading web literacy, we can help the Web remain open, accessible and a resource for everyone. 
              </p>                 

        <h3>3. Our values and Point-of-View.</h3>    
        <p>
            We decided on the values that clubs embody. We established the social practices we want to embed and repeat in the program. These values inform our point-of-view (POV) in our curriculum, leadership development and online tools. Our POV is compelling to our two personas and differentiates us.
            </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Why we teach: </b><i>This is our mission</i>.
                            <ul><li>We are dedicated to empowering others with web literacy so that they have agency on the web as creators, citizens and future leaders.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><b>How we teach: </b><i>This is our pedagogy.</i>
                            <ul><li>Teaching and learning is how we achieve our mission. They are political as well as self-actualizing acts. We teach and learn by making projects together and openly reflecting on the process in an inclusive and locally relevant environment. Learning is social, production-centered, and open-ended. It is done best when facilitated in small groups meeting in-person.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><b>Who we teach:</b> <i>This is our audience.</i>
                            <ul><li>We teach our peers, so that we can reflect and improve together. We teach our local community, so we can give back and make a different locally.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><b>What we teach:</b> <i>This is our subject.</i>
                            <ul><li>We teach web literacy, which encompasses the mechanics, culture and citizenship of the web. Our learners are more self-actualized as creators when they can use the web as a platform for creativity. They are better citizens when they can make more informed choices on the web. And they are economically more empowered with skills and practical knowledge of this public resources.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><b>Where we teach:</b> <i>This is our classroom.</i>
                            <ul><li>We teach locally, wherever we have our learners, be that in formal classrooms, to libraries and coffee shops and kitchen tables. We learn globally, as we connect with peers who inspire and mentor us to make local change that has a global impact.</li>
                            </ul>
        </ul>

            <h2 id="success">Success Is...</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Metrics.</h3>
        
        <p>
            We decided what it means to "be active in a city" for Mozilla Learning Networks in 2015. Our goal this year is 500 cities. A city has to fulfill one of the following to count:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>3 volunteer job roles</b> filled and reporting on local activity</li>
            <li><b>1 event per quarter</b> done by the same leader(s) (or pledged)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2. Naming.</h3>
        
        <p>
        We also discussed what to name this initiative and larger branding implications. Our conclusion: "Mozilla Academy"
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Focus on "Mozilla" as the uniting brand.</b> This is preferred over "Webmaker", "Hive" or other secondary brand. "Moz" can continue as suffix.</li>
            <li><b>Test out "Academy" </b>or similar name instead of "clubs." This clearly communicates learning, some structure, but also expandability. You can have one local Mozilla Academy, as well as a global online Mozilla Academy of all the mentors.</li>
            <li><b>Continue using generic suffix</b>, i.e. " __ Party", "__ Festival", "__ Learning Network" as the generic part of the Mozilla branding equation.</li>
        </ul>
        

        <h3>3. Organizing model. </h3>
        <p>
            To be successful, we need tiers of organizing. These were deeply informed by our affiliate comparison work and leveraging existing tiers. We anticipate needing three job roles, at least. The job descriptions are here: <a href="https://teach.etherpad.mozilla.org/clubroles">https://teach.etherpad.mozilla.org/clubroles</a>
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>Regional Coordinator</li>
            <li>Organizer</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1. Leadership Development. </h3>
        
        <p>
                We defined what leadership skills we want to foster in our community, the job descriptions that support and encourage their development, and the offering we provide to help them develop as leaders. This is what we agreed on needing, with tiers of access: Anyone [grab &amp; go for all resources], Club Leaders [grab &amp; go AND club-specific resources], Regional Coordinator [all the above AND regional coordinator training]

        <h3>2. Online Platform. </h3>
        
        <p>
        We scoped requirements and prioritized the phases of development. These tickets describe the features in scope for v1.0, aimed for release at the end of Q!: <a href="https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/Mozilla-Learning/labels/v1">https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/Mozilla-Learning/labels/v1</a>. The top-level summary of the v1.0 site is:
            </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Showcase resources for teaching and organizing</li>
            <li>Connect mentors to one another</li>
            <li>Show clubs on a map</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3. Curriculum. </h3>
            
        <ul>
            <li>We identified the two streams of curriculum we want to create and a path to packaging and testing it.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Web Literacy</i>: learners are end-users</li>
                    <li><i>Teach like Mozilla</i>: mentors are the end-users</li>
                </ul>
            <li>We concluded we want top-line curriculum partners for each module, including MDN, IMLS, Rio LAN Houses and Aspiration. Each module will have a final project with a light "give it forward" ask to go out and teach the module to someone else.</li>
            <li>Curriculum will be mobile-optimized and where possible, point to the Webmaker tool but not exclusively. It will include learning outcomes and questionnaires, as well as templates for featured remixes.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>This first quarter will focus on getting the module architecture right. Then in Q2 we'll work on distributed "barnraising" to populate later modules including writing out roles and incentives.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>See the curriculum queue: <a href="http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-curriculum/">http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-curriculum/</a>

        <h3>1. Partner Criteria</h3>
        
        <p>
                We've used "partnerships" in a very broad way in the past. Going forward, we want to be more specific about what a partner is, so we can better find and serve them, and so we can give our close partners the level of attention they need. <b>We would rather have fewer, more strategic and sustaining partnerships, than many light uninvolved ones.</b>  
        </p>
        
        
            <div class="well" id="silos">
              <ul>
                <li><i>A partner is eligible if they:</i></li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>have local nodes in 2+ cities</li>
                      <li>already have Regional Coordinators, or are committed to finding and sustaining them</li>
                      <li>are interested in our curriculum, organizing model or training</li>
                  </ul>
                  <li><i>Mozilla can deliver:</i>
                  <ul>
                      <li>on-boarding and continued support to the partner's Regional Coordinators</li>
                      <li>an organizing model</li>
                      <li>existing curriculum</li>
                  </ul>
                      </li>
                  <li><i>The partnership is closed when:</i>
                  <ul>
                      <li>the partner commits to fulfilling the Regional Coordinator role</li>
                      <li>a Mozilla staff organizer has met and confirmed the terms with the Regional Coordinator</li>
                      <li>under exceptional circustances, like notable funding or reach, any curriculum or organizing model adaptions have been scoped and agreed upon by the partner and the Mozilla staff organizer.</li>
                  </ul>
                      </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
        
        
        <h3>Maker Party</h3>
        
        <p>
        Campaigning is a powerful way to organize peaks and valleys for the community. This year, the Maker Party will evolve in the following important ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Asynchronous, instead of synchronous. </b>Spread throughout the year, instead of just two / three months.</li>
            <li><b>Super-localized. </b>Developing deep knowledge, partnerships, product learning, etc. e.g., When’re we’re focused on Brazil, we’re *really* focused on Brazil</li>
            <li><b>Focused where we have heat.</b> Our current base + key countries for 2015. </li>
            <li><b>Tightly integrated w. partner sales</b>Work even more closely w. partnerships / sales. </li>
            <li><b>Marketing supported</b>...</li>
            <li><b>Support and coordination with directed, niche marketing.</b> Trying to broader MoFo and Mozilla-wide efforts wherever possible.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            The emphasis for the Learning Network team is on leadership and organizing structure. Not just sustained activity, but also volunteers growing, getting better and more impactful -- and getting more responsibility as a result, building a larger-scale system by managing other volunteers, etc.
