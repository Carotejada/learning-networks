# Turning Club Learners into Facilitators 

## Why
Many Mozilla Clubs are starting all around the world with a seed group of volunteers from the local Mozilla Community or from the institution that is hosting it. It is common to see school, library staff and Mozillians acting as facilitators, but Clubs should not restrict their facilitation team to just that original seed group.

There is a good case to be made about leadership development opportunities for local learners inside Mozilla Clubs. You can  develop clubbers and their abilities in many areas beyond the digital skills they learn on Club Meetings, improving their people and organizational skills quickly. As an added bonus,you will also take some responsibility off of the current leadership to work on other projects or mentorships.

## Unlocking Potential
A set of simple tips are useful to unlock leadership skills in local learners:

* The Club environment needs to be extremely safe and welcoming. Learners need to have a trust relationship established with their leaders. A friendly environment will make learners more inclined to try new things.
* Learners must not be afraid of making mistakes. The practical “learning by doing” approach requires that mistakes are made so that the learner’s skills improve.By not being frightful of mistakes, the learners will take more chances when they used to lack confidence.
* Learners tend to complete activities at different times. Each person has their own pace and some are already more tech-savvy than others. Because of that, leaders need to take a two-pronged approach in their convenings:
    * Tip: Those that finish an activity ahead of others can be given some bonus features to try and develop their skills further, thus giving them something to work on while the others finish. **They should also be encouraged to help others. This is the most important one. By encouraging them to help others on their own way in a friendly and welcoming environment they will start experimenting with facilitation.**
    * Those that are still doing the activities should be encouraged to keep going at their own pace. It is important that learners do not see activities as a race of who finishs first or “who is best”. Give them the time to complete the activity and as they do, encourage them to help others. **Encouraging facilitation from those that finish an activity quickly and those that finish it more slowly builds confidence.**
    
## Identifying potential leaders
Learners will act as facilitators very naturally if the environmental conditions are right. **Identifying those that enjoy facilitation experiences is the key step in turning learners into facilitators.** Even though most learners will engage in helping other facilitators every now and then, not everyone wants to be a facilitator. To help identify those that can benefit the most from leadership development opportunities unlocked by facilitation, look for:

* Learners that engage with your team outside of event time. Proactive learners that contact your facilitators, Club Captain and crew (over social networks, face-to-face, or other channels) are showing signs of leadership.
* Those that repeatedly help others at events with a smile on their face and excitement about digital skills in their heart.
* The curious learners that are always asking more questions, specially the out-of-the-box ones about the activity.

## Unlocking facilitation skills
Once you find your leaders, you need to approach them and discuss the potential you’ve seen in them and encourage them to step up in the club as a leader.. Introduce an opportunity for them to engage in leadership and facilitation in your Club, but allow them to decline your offer. Be clear, but kind so that those who do not want to have deeper engagement or more commitment may remain in the Club as learners.

### Training your Leader
After you’ve gotten buy-in from your potential leader,There are many approaches to training. Think of the methods below as a toolkit  to remix for your own context. Use what you want, discard what you think doesn’t work.
#### Nuts and Bolts of an Activity
As normal club activities are run and your new facilitators start helping others in an ad-hoc manner, share with them some nuggets of why some aspect of the activity is that way.

* Example: In Kraken The Code from Web Literacy Basics I, tell the new leaders in training that the club is divided into two groups so that learners engage with each other instead of only looking at the computer. Explain to them that the truthfulness or falsehood of the existence of the Kraken (or whatever topic you chose to prove/disprove) is not relevant to the outcome of the activity but that the means and ways to reach any of those two hypothesis are the keys. Ask them to help both sides of the club, and have them realize that methods are the same regardless of what you are trying to prove. At the end of the event, ask your facilitators to join you and reflect about the facilitation experience itself and how the activity can be improved.

#### “Improve This Activity” Talk
After an event, get your new facilitators together and with the aid of post-it notes and markers, ask them what could be improved in today's activities. Even if they think that everything was perfect and that no change is required, ask them why they think that. You can also ask them to remix some part of a given activity. The objective is to realize that activities are adaptable and moldable to their own contexts and wishes. **The more they feel confident about tweaking an activity, the more they will “own” the club event.**

#### Providing Constructive Criticism
Remember that if you are rejecting some of their remixes or think that it is not a good idea, you need to explain why and come with an collective agreement about it. Every now and then, remember to try the remixed versions of the activities so that learners see that their input makes real change to the club.

#### Train-The-Trainer
Find another time besides your normal club event time to meet with your new facilitators so that you can have some time with them alone and focus on their needs and training, this will increase community engagement and your team bonding. If your events are in the afternoon, then, meet them in the morning so that their memories are fresh for the afternoon. If your events are in the morning then try to meet them the day before.

**Pick the activities you will be doing in your next meeting and do them first with your facilitators.** Have them all learn and practice if as if it was a standard club event. Once the activity is finished, run though a “Improve This Activity” session and chat about their experience and answer all questions about the activities.

Have them agree to “own” at least one activity from the your “train the trainers” section. During the event, have them lead the facilitation of that activity and help with the other activities. Since they are already familiar with all activities of the day, they will be able to help everyone from the start. You may want to do this multiple times before they feel confident enough to “own” an activity for the day.

**Don’t underestimate the power of leading an activity. During that experience, your original facilitator team and the new group become completely equal in their mind and in the learners mind.** The amount of personal realization, leadership skills and agency unlocked here are great, but the effort is not complete. There is another step to make your club event more awesome with your new leader.

## Moving towards a collaborative environment
As your new facilitators take more and more ownership of the activities, your club experience becomes more adapted to the local context since no one knows the region better than the learners themselves. As remixes become more frequent, it might be a good time to focus on making the club more collaborative. Slice your club event planning into discrete tasks and distribute them among your facilitators. The event is now owned by everyone and all are responsible for its execution.

To make clubs more collaborative, you can have the facilitators (old and new) join the event planning and take ownership of tasks related, such as:

* Decide on what activities to conduct.
* Experiment with activity creation
* Engage with learners and other clubs using social networks, sharing experiences with the larger club ecosystem.
* Promote collaborative decision making.

The collaborative approach to club event planning is not easy but it is a worthy goal. As you move towards it, you unlock more and more agency and leadership in everyone involved. In a collaborative environment, everyone owns a part of the club and all feel part of the clubs decisions and processes which leads to greater personal realization and fulfillment.
