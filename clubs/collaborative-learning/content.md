#Encouraging Collaborative Learning

**What is a collaborative project?**

In a collaborative project, all project members are involved in the design and making. Think about a centralized educational system as an example: when problems arise, we often see teachers blaming planners for making unrealistic, inapplicable policies, and planners blaming teachers for not doing what they’re supposed to.

In a collaborative project, the people who dream and plan also make and use. This allows for a very short feedback loop, and for a strong sense of responsibility and empowerment to make changes when needed. 

**Why make a collaborative project?**

All structures of learning have their own value and limitations. Take these two, for example:

* In a lecture, we can get inspired by the unique knowledge or experience of a charismatic professor. 
* In a participatory project, where the project designers offer us hands-on activities and include our feedback throughout, we can safely and actively engage a new area of learning. 

Both approaches are based on knowledge transfer. This means that when the learning process starts, the leader has knowledge and skills that others don’t, and as it progresses, learners acquire these skills and knowledge as their own.

A third structure of learning is a collaborative project and is a wonderful environment to stimulate collective intelligence and foster innovation. Collaborative learning is different from learning skills and ideas that already exist. As the project starts, participants bring different knowledge and skills to the table, and as the project matures, they discover and create ideas or products that didn't exist before in the group. The transfer of skills also happens as we interact to create together.

The collaborative approach also aims to reach project members’ wants and needs in the most efficient possible way. Some club communities may need more leisure, others more material resources, others basic literacy. This is a way of looking at learning that goes beyond skills, that takes all human needs into the core of the learning process, whether safety, food, or dialogue.

So if you feel that your club members want to be club makers, here are some guidelines and activities that can help you work as a collaborative team.


**What is needed for a collaborative project to happen?**

In our experience, the key to a sustainable collaborative project is a strong, empty center structure. “Empty center” means that the decision-making and responsibilities are neither centralized in a single person (a project manager or teacher, for example), nor decentralized (group leaders), instead, it is distributed to all project members.

With Mozilla Clubs, “structure” means that the people who join a Mozilla Club are not just left to improvise, they can see where and when to step in and have a sense of confidence that there are favorable conditions to make their ideas come true.

The empty center structure guaranties that power and responsibilities remain distributed, with multiple, temporary leaders spontaneously stepping up and stepping back at all stages of the project. Different project structures or the absence of formal structure often allow one or a few leaders to arise and centralize the project. More and more people are adopting successful empty center structures in different contexts, such as [Sociocracy](http://www.sociocracy.info/about-sociocracy/what-is-sociocracy/), [Art of Hosting](http://www.artofhosting.org/), Living systems theory, wikis, self-management, Occupy movements. 

The following is a pathway suggestion for Mozilla Clubs inspired from the [Dragon Dreaming](http://www.dragondreaming.org/) project design:

**A pathway for a collaborative structure**

This pathway is structured as a progression from Dreaming to Planning to Doing to Celebrating. It is designed to offer a balanced structure that allows creative space for the individual and collective, the rational and non-rational, the Club and its environment.


>Since most of our Club participants are RPGamers, we will also mention for each stage in the pathway a comparison with a step in a hero’s journey, such as the miraculous conception and birth, the call to adventure and supernatural aid, the challenges and transformation, and the return as a magical being. If you find that RPG culture is also strong in your Club, this might help you to build an inspiring narrative and setting for the process.


**Dreaming - the creative path from the individual to the collective vision**

If I work on your project, my creative energy may not be as entirely available as if I work on our project. If I’m a volunteer on your project, I may not see myself as crucially important for the project to happen as if I’m volunteering on our project.

We join a Mozilla Club because we are interested in developing digital skills and web literacy. With this commonality as a starting point, if we want all participants in the club to contribute their unique visions and skills to what we’re doing together, we need to make it clear that the collective is not just open to receiving suggestions, it is committed to shape the club according to its members dreams.

The dreaming stage of the project is when we connect to what makes our heart sing, without worrying if or how to make it happen. Many native people, such as the aborigines in Australia where Dragon Dreaming was created, or native Americans in Brazil, believe dreams contain a wisdom that needs to be shared with the community to guide our actions. The dreaming stage is when we express and share our inspiration as a collective.


>If this were a hero’s journey, that would be the hero’s miraculous conception and birth, and the initiation of the hero-child.


##Step 1 - Dream Circle

_Who?_ 3 to 12 people, willing to join regularly to participate in all stages of the project design at least for the next 6 months. Encourage children to participate.
_When?_ At the beginning of the collaborative project (the club may have had activities before) when enough people want to actively join as co-creators of the club.
_How long?_ 60-90 minutes
_Material needed?_ Flipchart and markers ; a talking stick/object (see below) ; adhesive tape ; a place where everybody can sit comfortably in a circle ; with a wall to stick several flipchart sheets.

Since few people are used to sharing their dreams, and often speak from a rational point of view, it is a good idea to set a comfortable atmosphere for dreaming with an initial fantasy story, or game.

The facilitator(s) of the dream circle will have chosen a generative question that connects to benefits that make it worthwhile to commit for the next 6 months. 
In a community where people have little time available, this might be:

>“What would this club have to be like so that afterwards you can say, you could not have spent your time in any better way?“

In a community where people are not used that their dreams are heard and taken seriously, this might be:
    
>“What do you dream for this club, so that you can say it is truly yours?”

In a community where people lack a sense of achievement, this might be:
    
>“What dreams would make you deeply proud of being a member of this club if they came true?”

To start the circle, this question is written on the flipchart. The talking stick, a chosen object that allows only the person holding it to speak, is at the center of the circle. The first person who has a dream in mind takes the talking stick, says their dream, and passes the stick to the person to their left.

During the circle activity:

* Anyone can skip their turn by just passing the stick to the person on their left, as the stick can be passed around as many times as necessary.
* Each dream should be a short phrase, no need to explain the reasons why this is your dream.
* Each dream should be a positive sentence, to focus on what the club will be like, instead of what it will not be like.
* Each person can say only one dream per turn.
* Since the stick can be passed around as many times as necessary, everyone can say as many dreams as they wish throughout the activity.
* There is no need to repeat a dream that was already said. 
* We don’t need to know if the dream is possible (we’re not planning or listing goals), we need to know it’s not impossible (we will try to make all dreams come true).
* Each dream is written on the flipchart with the dreamer’s name.

The dream circle ends when the talking stick has been passed around the entire group and no-one has contributed a new dream. Then, one of the group members with a taste for drama or performing reads out loud all the dreams in the past tense, in a tone of accomplishment (hey, this is meant to be fun), using “we” instead of the dreamers’ names. For example, if the dreams were...

* “Hélène: include more girls and women
* André: play with robotics
* Luigui: expand to other cities

...the reading will go…

 >“After 6 months of meeting with our club, we have included more girls and women! We have played robotics! We have expanded to other cities!”. 

Ask people how it felt to tell their dreams and to hear them in the past tense.

Signs that the dream circle is doing well: 

* The level of energy is growing, people are feeling inspired
* The talking stick is passing around quickly with many people saying their dreams
* People identify with dreams that were told by others
* It seems that the dreams of the group are manifesting something bigger for the Club

Signs that the circle is not doing well: 

* The dreams sound like plans (people are thinking, not  dreaming, remind them we don’t need to know it’s possible).

The rhythm is slow (are people comfortable? Are they justifying their dreams? Is it clear what they are here for?).

**Planning**

The planning stage is when we leave the realm of inspiration and enter that of thinking. This is when we take into account our human and material environment to design feasible strategies for the collective dream to come true. This is where club members get confirmation and confidence that their dreams are taken seriously, when they gain clarity of when and how to step in, and with whom.


>If this were a hero’s journey, that would be when the hero sets out for their quest, becomes a wanderer, and seeks and gains assistance from unpredictable places.


##Step 2 - Our goal

_Who?_ The people who did the dream circle (if there are newcomers, first read out the dreams for them and include their dreams too).
_When?_ After the dream circle, possibly on the same day or within a week.
_How long?_ 60-90 minutes
_Material needed?_ Post its ; flipchart and markers ; adhesive tape ; a place with a wall to stick the sheets with all the dreams from the dream circle ; circle stickers.

If the dream circle was made on a different day than the “goal” activity, start with a reading of the dreams in the past tense and have the sheets where they are written displayed on the walls, to jog everyone’s memory.

* Brainstorming. About 30 post-its are distributed between all members. The objectives are set through the Generative Question:

>“What things need to happen in the next 6 months to enable 100% of our collective dream to come true?”

Only one “thing that needs to happen” is written per post-it, and all post-its are stuck on a flipchart page.

When all post-its have been posted, two people go and stick together repeated post-its. Then, two or three other people arrange the 30 post-its into six to eight themes, and finally two to three other people give a title to each theme.

* Straw poll. Each member receives three circle stickers (three votes) to answer the following question: “Which objective(s), if given attention to first, will facilitate the achievement of the other objectives and make 100% of our Dream come true?”. The stickers can be used to vote for three separate themes, two themes (one theme getting two votes), or all three votes for one theme.

* Collective writing. Visualizing all these objectives and the group’s priorities, write one sentence that summarises the objectives for the next 6 months. This sentence is meant to guide us in our planning, encourage convergence of members’ contributions, and help us communicate about what we do at the Club if someone wants to join as a co-creator of the Club.

One person writes the first sentence, and then anyone can modify to make the sentence, clearer, shorter, more faithful to the collective dream, or more beautiful.

This is Rio Mozilla Club’s statement:

>“We want to engage and extend our team to make the Mozilla Clubs stronger, improving our efficiency and abilities to teach new digital skills in a fun and inclusive way”.

##Step 3 - Gameboard

_Who?_ The people who did the dream circle and goal (if there are newcomers, first read out the dreams for them and include their dreams too).
_When?_ After defining the goal, possibly on the same day or within two weeks.
_How long?_ 60-90 minutes
_Material needed?_ Post its ; flipchart, pens and markers ; adhesive tape ; a place with a wall to stick the sheets with all the dreams from the dream circle and our goal.

Divide a flipchart paper into 4 columns by folding the paper or drawing dots. Label the columns Dreaming, Planning, Doing and Celebrating.

20 to 25 post-its are distributed between the group members. Each person draws a circle in the corner of their post-its and writes one task per post-it in the top half, leaving the bottom half empty, answering the following question:

>What tasks must be performed over the next 6 months so that we reach our goal and make 100% of our collective dream come true?

Post all sticky notes on the paper in the adequate columns, the most urgent tasks at the bottom. If this helps you visualize a progression, you may first draw a tree over the paper, so the first tasks will be placed as roots, and the last ones as leaves and fruit. Can you see a balance of tasks between Dreaming, Planning, Doing and Celebrating? If not, try to reach a better balance by identifying missing or repeated tasks.

Draw a circle at the bottom center of the paper. This is the “beginning”. Then connect this “beginning” circle to the circle of the first task, and so on until the circle on all post-its is connected to at least one previous and one following task, and possibly more.

##Step 4 - Stepping in

_Who?_ All active members (if there are newcomers, first read out the dreams for them and include their dreams too).
_When?_ After drawing the to-do tree, possibly on the same day or within two weeks.
_How long?_ 30-45 minutes
_Material needed?_ The To-Do Tree ; red, blue and green pens ; post-its ; tape ; a blank sheet of paper.

This is when Club members step in to take an active part in fulfilling the tasks that were collectively identified in the gameboard. Let participants know that it is worse to have someone volunteer for a task and not fulfilling it, than no-one volunteering for the task.

Then, write on the sheet of paper the following colour-code and stick it next to the gameboard: 

Red = Knight (action)
Blue = Sage (advice)
Green = Apprentice (helping the knights)

This means that, if a person has expertise on a task and wants to be in charge of fulfilling it, they write their name in red (Knight) on a post-it and stick it next to the post-it where the task is written. If they have expertise about the task that they can share as a kind of consultant, but do not want to be responsible for fulfilling it, they write their name in blue (Sage). And if they have no expertise, but would like to learn about this specific task by helping the person in charge, they write their name in green (apprentice).

All names can be written on the same post-it. There should be at least one name in red for each task (one knight), and there can be as many apprentices and advisors as you wish. All participants should have written their name at least once. Beware of overload… it is better to volunteer only for what can reasonably be achieved. If some tasks are left without a red name, either suppress them or find some help from new members or temporary collaborators.

Ask people to take note of the tasks they have volunteered for and their role, as well as the people working on the same tasks with them, and the people working on the tasks connected to their own on the do-do-tree. These are the task that depend on theirs to be done, or that they depend on to do their own.

Succession planning: everyone should feel free to leave the club when they want or need to. At the same time, this should be done in a responsible way, that takes care of the club and the people who keep it alive. This means finding replacement as soon as possible for the tasks one is committed with, with enough time for apprenticeship.

##Step 5 - Sustainability

Before crossing the threshold between planning and doing, you need to know if your team is committed and resilient enough to face the challenges and demands that will arise in the doing stage. This means having at least four people profoundly committed to the club as their own, and no single person essential for the club to exist and be active.

Commitment of the team: most teams are made of people with different levels of commitment, who bring complementary contributions to the project. When identifying the level of commitment of club members, they should feel free to be sincere about a low or a short-term commitment, and confident that their participation on the team will be equally valued, however much committed they are.

The test consists in asking each member the following question, in a mindset that values the “no” as much as the “yes” answers:

>If the club went out of funding, would you be prepared to sustain it out of your own pocket if at least 3 other club members did so together with you?

If four or more people answered “yes” to this question, you can go ahead with the doing stage confidently. If less than four people answered yes, run a “force field analysis” (see below) and make the changes necessary for more people to reach a deeper level of commitment before you go on with the doing stage.

Empty center:  It is crucial for the sustainability of the project that no member be indispensable for the club activities, not even a founder or teacher. The test is easy: is there someone who is part of all or virtually all decisions? Someone club members ask if it is possible to join the club or to implement their ideas? Someone whose absence reduces the club’s activities?

If you identify some key members that the club is depending on, invite them to train someone to replace them while their energy is still high, with enough time of apprenticeship ahead that the history of the club is kept alive when the key members depart, even temporarily.

##Optional budget drumming

If your club needs budgeting, the dragon dreaming method can work for this topic as well. The idea is to make it fun, quick and intuitive. Through the magic of collective intelligence,  budget drumming has been known to reach the same level of accuracy as longer, detailed and math-based budgeting methods.

_Who?_ The people who stepped in as knights and sages for a task and possible partners for these tasks, even if they are not a club member. This session requires two “MCs”, one drummer leading the beat, and one crier shouting the tasks and writing the budget.
_When?_ After stepping in with our names for a task, possibly on the same day or up to two weeks later.
_How long?_ 20mn
_Material needed?_ The gameboard, a pencil, a drum or anything that makes a nice beat, a place where everybody can sit facing the gameboard.

Warm up: Make sure everybody has taken a close look at the gameboard and knows what the tasks mean, even if they don’t know how to achieve them. Let them know that when the beat starts the MC next to the tree (this sounds great) will shout a task, and anyone can shout back the first value that comes to their minds for this task. The crier then writes down a rough average of the values heard (this is meant to be intuitive and quick, don’t lose the rhythm to do the maths) and goes on shouting the next task. Yes, that’s how it’s done. 

Get into the rhythm: chose a rhythm that the club members know and enjoy so that everybody can drum along if they feel like doing so. It should be lively enough to keep the energy high during the entire activity, and not too quick so that people have enough time to get from one task to another together. Start drumming, and announce this unusual budgeting in a loud voice and in any way that combines with the mood and chosen rhythm. This might be rapping or in a town crier fashion: “Hear ye! Hear ye! All ye knight of the open web! We are gathered here to face the costs of our tasks!”. Here in Rio we would most certainly beat a “funk carioca”.

Wrap it up: When every task has a value next to it, the crier shouts the first value plus the next one, and the rest of the team says the result, until all values have been added up and we have the total. Add 15% for contingencies and you get your final budget.

Doing: Most of the doing phase is made up of the tasks that are on the gameboard. It is often the most challenging in the project and requires a high level of energy, activity and connexion. As we set to make our dreams come true, we face interferences, we may feel exhausted, and we need to sacrifice those things that are preventing the fulfillment of our project. It is also the time of greatest learning and achievement.


>If this were a hero’s journey, that would be when the hero faces struggle, trial, transformation and achievement.


##Step 6 - Monitoring progress

_Who?_ The people who stepped in for a task, at least one person for each task.
_When?_ Two to four weeks after “stepping in”, when all people involved are already doing their tasks, and then on a regular basis once or twice a month until all tasks from the gameboard are completed.
_How long?_ 40 to 50mn
_Material needed?_ The gameboard ; a pencil and eraser.

Interview: all participants sit in pairs with someone who is working on different tasks from their own. One person is the interviewer and asks the other one (the interviewee):

* What their task was and their role in it (knight, sage or apprentice)?
* What were their group’s dreams for the task?
* What were their group’s plans for the task?
* What have they achieved?
* How do they feel about the task’s progress?
* If they need any help and how? Or even replacement?

The interviewer can also ask other questions to better understand the situation, however they can only ask and not give advice or opinion. After five to ten minutes, swap roles, and have five to ten more minutes of conversation.

Filling the circles: one participant at a time stands next to the gameboard, choses one of their interviewee’s tasks and tells the rest of the group about the progress. The next step is to fill the circle at the bottom of the post-its of the corresponding tasks according to their progress as follows:

* Divide the circle into four quarters.
* The top right-hand quarter is “dreaming” (like human creative activity, set in the right hemisphere of the brain), then going counterclockwise,
* The top left-hand quarter is “planning” (like human rational activity, set in the left hemisphere of the brain),
* The bottom left-hand quarter is “doing”,
* And the bottom right-hand quarter is “celebrating”.

The interviewer says what quarters they understand that their interviewee’s team has fully been through, and asks them if they agree. Then the quarters of the circle are filled in by the interviewer according to the team’s view of their progress. And so on until all tasks have been gone through.

In addition to the visualization of the project’s progress, this activity aims to provide collective support to members who might need it, as well as remembering everyone that dreaming and celebrating are equally important as planning and doing.

##Optional force field analysis

_Who?_ As many club members as possible.
_When?_ Any time you need clarity about the club’s assets and challenges, especially if your club is stuck in or going through a challenging moment.
_How long?_ 40 to 50mn
_Material needed?_ Your club’s statement ; flipchart or whiteboard with markers ; one sheet of paper per participant ; one pen or pencil per participant in two different colours.

This part is inspired from the Force Field Analysis created by social psychologist Kurt Lewin in the 1940’s, that is now used in businesses, NGOs and individual coaching processes to promote change and achievement.

Brainstorming: start with your club’s statement posted on the wall. Divide the white board into two columns, or stick two flipchart sheets side by side on the wall (check if the markers’ ink might go through the paper to avoid staining the wall). Ask the club members to write on one half of the board (or one flipchart paper) anything that they feel is hindering the club’s progress towards achieving the goals, and on the other half (or paper) anything that they feel is supporting the progress. It is important that every member comes to the board to write themselves, and not one person staying by the board writing for everyone else. 

Evaluation: When the flow of ideas is declining, or when they become repetitive, ask each person to take a sheet of regular paper, divide it into four columns, and list all the challenges in the first columns on the left, and all the assets in the last columns on the right, in the same order. If your group is large and you have a copy machine at hand, you can make one version of these columns and lists and copy it for the rest of the group.

Then ask each person to individually assign a grade between one and five to each topic on both lists. A five means this topic strongly hinders or supports the club, a one means this topic has a minor influence in the person’s opinion. The middle vertical line stands for zero for both lists. The line that divides the two columns on the left stands for five (negative), the line that divides the two columns on the right also stand for five (positive).

Perception: When everybody is done, ask them to add up the scores in each column and calculate the average score for the challenges and the one for the assets. By adding these two averages (remember the left one is negative), this gives an idea of the person’s perception of the club’s present situation. A negative result shows a perception that the club is presently stuck, a positive result means the clubs is presently working. The general average of all individual analyses gives a snapshot of the group’s perception of the club’s present situation.

Change: Using a different colour pen, ask each person to assign a new grade to all topics in both lists according to what they believe can be changed within the club’s resources (human and material, both present and ). Then make an average for each column, and add up both columns. This represent each person’s perception of the club’s validity and potential. A negative result shows a perception that the club is unsustainable, a positive result shows a perception that the club is valid and how much potential it has. The general average gives a snapshot of all member’s idea of this potential.

Visualize priorities: Ask everyone to draw a line that vertically connects the grades for each column, and in both colours. You should have two vertical zigzag lines in each column, in two different colours. You may now compare the charts that each person drew and identify if they stick out in similar areas, in order to identify priorities for change, and sustain your assets.

##Step 7 - Celebrating

Celebrating is when we revive our energies individually and as a community. It is when we name and honour what has been achieved and what has been learnt, or even when we mourn what has been lost. It is a collective tribute to what we value most, and a time for new dreams to find their way within us. We strongly recommend that celebrating be 25% of the project in terms of time together and economic investment.

If this were a hero’s journey, after transforming themselves, the hero has become a magician, able to change some aspects of the world around them.

_Who?_ All the people involved in the club and people who want to discover it.
_When?_ Anytime the group energy is waning, or a significant achievement happened, or a cycle is closing..
_How long?_ As long as you wish.
_Material needed?_ A pleasant setting where people can enjoy together their time and conversations, food and drinks.

Every club event should end up with a celebration that accounts for 25% of the event’s total time. Then, when you’re preparing for a final celebration to close a six-month cycle, for example, the celebrating team can make a shorter version of dreaming and planning with all club members in order to make it a very special time for all.

There are many ways people have practiced celebration over time and cultures. Singing, dancing, storytelling, food and drink sharing and rituals are some of them that may inspire your club. You can tell it is going well if the following is happening:

* Expression of gratitude and thankfulness, for individuals and for the community
* Expression of emotions
* Relaxing (no matter whether in a quiet or vivid style)
* Naming what has been learnt and achieved
* People realize that they have changed, that experience is transformation
* People are feeling welcome and nurtured
* New people want to join the club, new dreams are emerging
