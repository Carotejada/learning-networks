#Moving From Participation to Collaboration
Developed by: Hélène Pétry, Carolina Tejada Alvarez, Kristina Gorr and the Mozilla Clubs team

Do you know the characteristics of participation versus collaboration? They both have their own value and limitations. In education, we tend to lecture our thoughts and then go to some type of participation format where students discuss the thoughts they just heard. This guide will help your Mozilla Club to move safely and efficiently from participative learning to collaborative learning.

##“Participation” vs. “Collaboration”

**Participation** is engaging in a topic, discussion, or activity at hand. There is nothing bad or wrong with participation and a sign of a healthy Club is excellent participation! However…

**Collaboration** is to join in, assist, and to be a part of the process, with the unified goal of a better and more successful outcome. This is the next level of participation and provides even more success and building up of leadership within Clubs.

##Facilitation Tips

Moving your Club from participation-centric to collaboration-centric, if done successfully, will result in participants self-organizing and stepping into various roles to meet their needs, the needs of others, and the club’s needs. You can help facilitate this healthy shift using the following tips:

* Ensure that your participants are clear in what they want to learn and are confident that their goal will be heard by you and the rest of the club. You can do this by doing self reflection activities, and opening up discussion for feedback on the Club environment.
* Encourage participants to connect their emotions, inspirations and goals with their educational community and future. This link will ensure they do what is necessary to collaborate with others, not only to achieve their goals, but to also help others achieve their goals.
    * Activities that give them an opportunity to connect with their emotions (1 - happy memory), with their inspiration (2 - dream) before they get to rational thinking (3 - planning) tend to trigger the impulse for action (4 - stepping in). This is a great outcome and one that harbors collaboration!
* Build and plan your Mozilla Clubs meeting agenda using collaborative tools and welcome feedback or ideas from all members
    * Example of collaborative tools: [Github](https://github.com/), [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) and, [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org/). See more examples in the Resources section below.
* Create projects with your students from inception, instead of on your own. This encourages collaboration in every aspect of your Mozilla Club!
* Encourage individuals to work together in meaningful ways. Ask individuals who like to participate a lot to help champion the more quiet individuals. 

##Activity Ideas

There are tons of great activities that encourage collaboration at [learning.mozilla.org/activities](https://learning.mozilla.org/activities). Here are a quick list of suggested activities to help your Mozilla Club move from participation to collaboration:

* Personal Presentation Icebreakers: Sit in a circle and...
        * Tell us about a time when you felt motivated to be a leader?
        * What inspires you?
* Post-It Note Q&A/Discussions: Provide a prompt and have participants write answers/feedback on a post-it note, then stick it to a wall. Facilitate discussion afterwards.
    * Prompt Ideas:
        * If you were Club Captain, what would be your first order of business?
        * What does participation look like to you? What does collaboration look like to you? How are they different?
        * What online tools do you use for collaboration?
        * Who inspires you as a great leader?
* [Para Para Animation Teaching Kit](https://karenlouisesmith.makes.org/thimble/para-para-animation-teaching-kit): This activity helps learners create simple animations and learn about online collaboration using Parapara. Try making one story as a team!
