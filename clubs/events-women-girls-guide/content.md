#Tips for designing safe and inclusive events for women and girls

Running events for women and girls require careful strategy and execution. Often times, there are many situational factors at play that are affecting an individual’s comfort, attention and participation that a facilitators should be aware of. It’s important to design your events for women and girls with them in mind, making sure you are encouraging a gender appropriate, inclusive and supportive environment. 

In this guide you will find tips on,

* How to create safe learning spaces
* Handle difficult topics that might arise
* Understand personal biases
* Design for optimal participation

##Creating Safe Spaces

Leading up to the event, it’s important to share clear communication with attendees and address any safety concerns regarding location, scheduling and logistical factors. Make sure attendees feel like they are able to come and attend a space safely and comfortably. Clearly identify the purpose of the event and the value they will gain as a participant as it relates to both gender and local context. For example, sending a pre-event email to attendees telling them that "the event is female-only and is meant to be a space where women can share, support and collaborative with each other" will allow participants to come to the event with that mindset. 
 
While at the event, create a comfortable learning and sharing environment by sharing ground rules at the beginning. The point of the ground rules is to create an inclusive space by making sure that individuals feel they can express feelings, opinions and ideas in a way that are welcome and encouraged.

Here are some example ground rules:

* The goal of the event is to create a safe place for everyone to share opinions and ideas 
* Everyone’s opinions are valid and important. There are no bad ideas.
* The information shared by individuals within the session will be held with respect and anonymity.
* The conversation is not meant to discredit any person, organization, group, demographic or gender.
* The conversation is being held with the intent to understand how to make the Internet an open and safe place.
* This is an open environment where we have all come to learn from each other.
* We are not here to be mean, negative, sarcastic or attack each other
* Say “I” when expressing your opinion so it doesn’t sound like you are speaking for an unknown collective group
* ……[view this guide to setting ground rules](http://www.edchange.org/multicultural/activities/groundrules.html)

Ask attendees if there are any other norms that might benefit the group? Give attendees information about what or who they can contact during the event if they want to ask questions or address concerns. This might be volunteering yourself, other mentors or directing to external support channels. Once you have created a space where individuals feel they can contribute shift the conversation to what you are there to learn about that day.

###Activities that create safe spaces

Consider including activities, games or icebreakers that help reinforce a safe/supportive/collaborative space or create a gender-supportive environment.

Some ideas include:

* Run through [this code of conduct exercise](http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/code_of_conduct/) that will walk you through some of the considerations associated with anti-harassment policies, and help you put in place a plan and process for creating a welcoming, inclusive, harassment-free space. 
* Before running an activity ask each attendee to share why the topic being covered at the event matters to them (if appropriate ask them specifically why it matters for females in their location).
* [Run a spectrogram](https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/how-to-run-a-spectrogram-icebreaker) and ask questions containing gender-specific language. Ex. “As a women I feel the Internet is a safe place to use.”
* At the end of the event have individuals share, either publically or privately, their appreciation for something another women in the room said or did at the event. If opting for more private appreciation, give individuals a few minutes at the end of the event to go up to each other directly(make sure it’s mandatory and don’t be alarmed if it looks like individuals are scrambling everywhere!). 


## Dealing with Difficult Topics

Often when addressing issues and concerns related specifically to women and girls it can be a high-risk conversation. A high-risk conversation means that participants will have strong emotional reactions and feelings towards what is being discussed. Facilitators should be aware of the risk and expect certain types of triggers (also known as tension points) to occur. These often occur when dealing with,

* Gender
* Race
* Sexual preference
* Violence (both online and offline)
* Privacy and security
* Culture differences 
 
These triggers can result in individuals:

* Blaming themselves, outsiders or each other
* Frustrated over identify including sexual preference, gender, culture etc.
* Becoming embarrassed or uncomfortable and not participating
* Feeling overwhelmed by the reaction of others in the room
* Feeling unsupported or isolated because of comments made
 
Here are some tips to help make sure you are creating a space that is as safe as possible for all individuals when engaging in high-risk conversations:

* Tell individuals you are talking about sensitive topics before the event so that they have time to digest and reflect on their own
* Reference the agreed upon ground rules when needed
* Encourage the opinions of those who are might no longer be sharing, if more appropriate ask them why they weren’t participating in a 1-1 setting which they will find more comfortable
* Ask individuals to focus on outcomes and solutions, instead of solely focusing on the problems
* Do regular check-ins with the attendees to see how they feel after a hard conversation. This should be done as a group, although you may choose to do further check-ins with individual people afterwards



## Understanding Unconcious Biases

What is unconscious bias?

* Your mind makes 50,000 “fast” associations per one “slow” association
* It bases these on information it has been passively collecting for your whole life
* The unconscious mind is powerful and may surprise you
* We do not control unconscious bias but we do control conscious action so this is an opportunity to get rid of guilt and blame but take responsibility for change.

Test your unconcious bias by going to implicit.harvard.edu Select your language and click go (sign in as guest). Select the Gender-Career IAT test. 

We often don't realize we make bias decision. It's important to understand more about your own personal biases and reflect upon your choice of wording, actions and presence as a facilitator.  

## Designing for Participation

It’s important that in events, facilitation and material are created or adapted for events with women and girls. Here’s a checklist to review before your event:

* Is the curriculum, resources and media being used include gender sensitivity and inclusion?
* Are the exercises and learning hands-on, interactive and allow individuals to work in groups?
* Have we predetermined working groups that mix of up the crowd and ensure a variety of personalities?
* Is the curriculum, resources and material sensitive to certain external factors that are most common with women, such as abuse, cyber violence, child safety, privacy etc?
* Are sensitive topics being covered and if so am I aware of the triggers that might occur and how to handle them?
* Are there opportunities to talk in small groups where individuals may be more comfortable sharing their opinion?
* Are there opportunities for participants to be assigned roles such as moderator, time-keeper, note-taker, etc.?
* Are there safe places you can point attendees to after the event to continue sharing, talking and reflecting with others?
 
Remember to be,

* Open to real conversations where individuals can be vulnerable and open
* Honest to each other
* Respectful of different ideas and backgrounds
* Understanding of different perspectives
* Preview material ahead of time to ensure that it is appropriate for workshop participants 
* Applauding good behaviour or when individuals participate in ways that might be out of the norm for themselves
