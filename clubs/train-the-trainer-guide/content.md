Now let's start with what you need to know before your training!

##Before the event

The first step involves organizing your event and determining the logistics needed in order to host a training. 

Once the details are coming together identify your audience of facilitators, mentors, Club Captains or other attendees. Make sure you understand their skill level, needs or interests and develop an agenda that addresses these various levels. 

Make sure your agenda matches both the needs of your audience and the amount of time you have with them.

Decide which facilitators will lead which part of the workshop beforehand. 

Create a shared document or other project management tool to keep track of the tasks you need to do ahead of the training. For example, you may need to revise a lesson, print materials, and make sure someone brings any special equipment or supplies.

Schedule a few check-ins before the workshop so that facilitators can ask one another questions and build up common trust in each other and the agenda.

Test as much technology as you can before the event. Have a backup plan ready in case of technical trouble.

###Set an agenda
Look through these outlines and examples of training events that have happened in the past. You can use them as a template for your own!

*  [IPPD Web Literacy Leaders Training](https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/chadsansing/31650/)
*  [Mozilla Club Leadership Training](https://thimbleprojects.org/amira/63662/) 
*  [Mozilla Web Literacy Leaders Two-Day Training Module](https://thimbleprojects.org/chadsansing/69898/index.html#overview) 
*  [Teaching how to read, write and participate on the web with NWP](https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/chadsansing/14616/) 
*  [Teach the Web training for NCS Champions](https://laura.makes.org/thimble/teach-the-web-webmaker-and-ncs-teaching-kit) 
*  [Professional Development workshop by Mouse and Mozilla](https://mousemeredith.makes.org/thimble/LTExOTM0MTA1Ng==/summer-webmaker-institute) 

###Invite attendees
Once you have established your audience, location, date and time you are ready to invite your attendees.

1. Send your potential attendees an email asking them to RSVP.
2. Have them RSVP using an application form. [Here’s a sample form.](https://www.eventninja.io/e/web-literacy-leaders-mozilla-winter-ippd-2299) 
3. Two days before the event send a reminder of event details. 

##Set-up

It is important to consider the room set-up when facilitating an open and collaborative learning environment. 

###Do,
*  Arrive early to set-up the space.
*  Place post-it notes, pens and markers at the center of each table. If you have stickers or swag you can place these here too.
*  Place people in circles or spread your tables around the room. This will allow for a collaborative environment.  
*  If possible, make sure there is space between tables or other gathering spots so facilitators and participants can move (or “flow”) easily around the room.
*  Post the wifi password in a place that is visible for everyone to see.
Have easy access to outlets. You might consider bringing in some extension cords and power strips. 
Make the best use of your space and surrounding areas. Consider having an activity or brainstorm outside if the weather permits. 
*  Test all tech in advance! Computers, wifi, audio, projectors and any other technical needs. If possible, develop your own “training kit” and bring a small projector and speaker you know you can count on for the day.
*  Have a sign-in sheet that is visible when learners enter the space and consider posting a facilitator nearby to welcome people, point toward the sign-in sheet, and answer logistical questions about where to put belongings or how to find the bathroom, etc.

###Don’t,
*  Have tables lined up in a lecture style format. This formal–or one-to-many–set-up doesn’t encourage the collaborative, open learning style that is needed in training. People should face one another, not one another’s backs.
*  Use a dark and small room that doesn’t allow for fresh air or light. 
*  Have activities that are based at the same spot or around the tables. Spread out your activities around the room. 
*  Block the doors - make sure it’s easy for individuals to move freely and quickly in a non disruptive way. 
*  Set up seats or tables far from the facilitator so individuals might not be able to hear.

When starting your training, or any event, there are many things to remember. To make sure you don’t forget anything we’ve created a short checklist that you can reference when welcoming your learners. 

###The introduction checklist:

*  Introduce the facilitators or other mentors. Explain everyone’s roles. 
*  Introduce the space or organization hosting you and invite them to say a few words.
*  Share general information that is relative to the environment. Where is the bathroom? Where are the emergency exits? Where to take a quick break? What time does the training end? When is lunch?
*  Ask attendees to introduce themselves. Quick tip: ask participants to say their name, where they are from and what they are looking forward to learning today. 
*  Share the agenda or make sure it is visible. Bonus points if you print it and have it ready for each attendee to reference throughout the day. 
*  Set the expectations for the day. What exactly are participants going to learn from attending your event? 
*  Set some ground rules. What is appropriate behaviour? Things like: one mic, a hand signal for when someone says a word/phrase that needs to be defined, etc.
*  Make sure everyone is connected to the wifi. If you are using computers make they are all working and connected. 
*  If taking photos/video, explain where they may be posted/shared, and to let a facilitator know if they prefer not to be photographed.
*  Share a forum or place for feedback. Share the link and instructions on how to login or participate. 

###Start with an engaging, participatory activity
Whether your learners know each other or not it’s always good to start with an activity that allows people to move around and interact with each other. This can help break the ice and get them into the right frame of mind. 
Often, a simple hands-on activity that participants can do together is the best way to introduce a technical concept. By making something or performing something together, participants can help one another understand your content and build trust that they will keep helping each other on more technical parts of the lesson.

At Mozilla we love these activities:

*  Spectrogram. This activity requires standing, moving and a healthy discussion. Best of all, it is adaptable to any topic you are covering that day. [Here’s a guide to running a spectogram](https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/how-to-run-a-spectrogram-icebreaker) and here’s [how you can adapt the spectogram at a teach the web training event.](https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/chadsansing/31650/spectrogram.html) Note: this works best when choosing polarizing/controversial statements where people have varying opinions/perspectives.
*  A strong wind blows. This activity also requires standing up and some running around. It’s a good way to learn each attendee’s individual skills in the room. [Here’s the guide to running this activity.](https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/a-strong-wind-blows-for-the-open-web) 
*  Tag Tag Revolution. This activity, created by our friends at Mouse, is a quick HTML game that involves moving, shaking and dancing. [Here’s the guide to running this activity.](https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/chadsansing/31650/tag-tag-revolution.html)
*  Perform the Net. This activity gives attendees the chance to act out how the Internet works. [Here’s the lesson plan.](https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/chadsansing/31650/perform-the-net.htm) 


##Mozilla and Web Literacy

Once the room is energized and back in their seats, this is when we usually share more information about the individuals or organizations running the training. Be sure to share your role and any relevant experience you might have. 

As a representative of Mozilla this would be the time to share your work and what it means to be a contributor to the Mozilla project. Be sure to include how your work interacts with what individuals are doing that day. If individuals are not aware of Mozilla you might want to highlight some key points like,

*  Mozilla is a non-profit that is dedicated to protecting the Internet as a global public resource.
*  Mozilla is made up of a global community of people who believe that openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued  health of the Internet.
*  Mozilla is dedicated to helping turn consumers of the web into producers of the web who understand the choices they have about authorship, privacy, and security online.
*  Mozilla is also cultivating a global network of leaders who are teaching and learning web literacy, broadly defined as the ability to read, write and participate in the digital world.
*  Encourage attendees to visit and use the free curriculum, tools and resources at [learning.mozilla.org](https://learning.mozilla.org) 
*  Teach in a way that is engaging, participatory, fun and user centric. With the principle that doing and making is at the core of how an individual learns. It also follows the principles of the Web Literacy Map. 

Are there other organizations present or being represented in a formal manner? Similar to above, share why their work is relevant to the training and give a brief overview.  

###Web Literacy Map 

Mozilla understands web literacy to be the skills and competencies required to read, write and participate effectively on the web. Knowing how to read, write, and participate in the digital world has become the 4th basic foundational skill next to the three Rs—reading, writing, and arithmetic—in a rapidly evolving, networked world. Having these skills on the web expands access and opportunity for more people to learn anytime, anywhere, at any pace.

Core to this work is the Web Literacy Map 2.0:

*  Core skills needed to read, write, and participate on Web. This means being able to understand the mechanics, culture and citizenship of the web by helping people work more open, become citizens of and contributors to the web. The competencies listed on the map detail what it means to read, write and participate in ways that can create a positive impact for the web and user. 
*  21C Skills: problem-solving, creativity, collaboration, and communication.  This refers to a broad set of knowledge, skills, work habits, and character traits that are important to succeed in today’s world, particularly for college and career readiness and in the workplace. Examples of these skills include collaboration, communication, creativity, and problem-solving. 

For more information [read the whitepaper on why Mozilla cares about Web Literacy.](http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-whitepaper/)

Dig into the skills and competencies [here.](https://learning.mozilla.org/activities/web-literacy/) When you use our curriculum you will notice in the top corner that each activity indicates which skills and competencies of the Web Literacy Map you are teaching while using that activity. 

##Activities

This is the meat of your training! You want to run activities that show your learners how to teach web literacy skills through various tools and curriculum. You can use those available at [learning.mozilla.org/activities](https://learning.mozilla.org/activities) or integrate others as well. This section is curated and decided by you. In the past, we have found these activities provide a fun and fundamental framework:

When teaching X-Ray Goggles,

*  Do the [sample activity on the homepage](https://goggles.mozilla.org/) 
*  [Hack the news](http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-curriculum/WebLiteracyBasics-I/session02-hackthenews.html) 

When teaching Thimble,

*  [The homework excuse generator](https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/chadsansing/31650/homework-excuse-generator.html) 
*  [My six-word learning story](https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/chadsansing/14616/six-word-learning-story.html) 
*  [Other activities](https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/chadsansing/14616/thimble-cyoa.html) 

Others,

*  [Videos and activities to teach encryption](https://advocacy.mozilla.org/encrypt/) 
*  [Run a spectrogram for privacy](https://chadsansing.github.io/curriculum-testing/expanded-privacy-curriculum/privacy-spectrogram) 
*  [Use Lightbeam in this activity to learn about tracking](http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-curriculum/ProtectingYourData/session02-lightbeam.html) 

###Do,
*  Pick activities that require people to be moving, engaged and collaborating. Think of your audience and try to have a balance of activities that are relative to their work, field or skill level. 
*  Choose a mix of different types of activities and tools. 
*  Share your personal experiences/anecdotes to help people if they're having trouble applying to their own context.
*  Encourage group work wherever and whenever you can.
*  Offer time for questions and reflections. Also allow for breaks between activities and time for individuals to connect and talk with each other. 
*  Send links to activities afterwards so learners can continue to engage on their own time. 
*  Be aware of the different skill levels of those in the space. If some individuals are advanced welcome them to go ahead and start making while you describe step-by-step instructions to others. 
*  Think-aloud as you work through lessons. Explain the what and why of each step to make whatever you model clearer for your audience.
*  Take time to connect later parts of the workshop to earlier parts. Explain how what you did earlier helps the group tackle the next task up now.

###Don’t,
*  Use activities that have people working in silos at their computers for long periods of time. 
*  Have all activities rely on the internet. Incorporate some offline, or lo-fi to no-fi activities. 
*  Jump from one activity to another. Give breaks and allow for spaces between activities to have feedback and reflection periods. 
*  Use slides unless you really need them. Most of the time you can use the activity as a placeholder on the screen or the tool itself. 
*  Play music unless it is either quiet or not interrupting group conversation. 
*  Play videos more than 10% of the time. If there are relevant videos that individuals might enjoy send it in a list of resources after the event. 

There are many aspects that go into teaching how to run an activity. Consider these facilitation tips:

###Do,
*  Walk around and have designated helpers assisting others who need help. Ask learners to silently raise their hand when stuck so mentors can identify them. 
*  Give reminders about how much time is left in given activity. If you are wanting to proceed to the next step but users are actively engaging make sure you tell them that you will regroup in a specified number of minutes. 
*  Be flexible with your agenda. If individuals or groups are really enjoying an activity let them continue to explore and adjust other activities. If they aren’t enjoying an activity, quickly move on and proceed to something new. 
*  Have individuals in the room share their experiences after an activity. What did they learn? What did they find interesting? How did their thinking change?
*  Ask how learners would integrate the activity in their space, classroom, library etc.
*  Read the room. Are people too hot? Are they falling asleep? Try opening a door/window or doing an activity that gets them moving. If individuals have been sitting for a couple of hours consider doing a quick stretch (this can be especially true after meals!). 
*  Model failure and troubleshooting. Show that it’s okay if a mistake or error happens, and that the best response is to work through a solution, rather than to shut down or skip a step.

###Don’t,
*  Stand in front of the room running a lecture-style presentation from your computer.
*  Let the same individuals control the whole conversation. If you see the same people raising their hand be sure to say that you are looking to hear from those who haven’t yet participated. 
*  Force everyone to stay on the same step. If others jump ahead they can act as impromptu mentors for others that need help. 
*  Use acronyms, big words, technical terms or language that others won’t understand. If you do, make sure that individuals in the room know what they mean.  

##Closing

Provide on-site reflection to allow for immediate opportunities to synthesize, share, and maximize participant experiences, and make adjustments (for the current event or for future ones). Ask learners to share what they learned during the event and how they plan on using their new skills afterwards. You can ask those comfortable to share or go in a circle around the room. Try to encourage all participants to have a reflective moment. Also provide a space or place, such as an online survey,  for feedback after the event on the facilitation, structure and content. You want to know what worked and what didn’t for learners. 

Think of ways to keep your participants engaged in the web literacy community. Suggest ways they can contribute to existing projects or create their own. Name the communications channels they can use to keep in touch. This can be participating in the online forum, joining a follow-up call, completing an activity on their own, sharing their experience with a friend or completing feedback. Choose some, or all, tasks and make sure your learners are comfortable completing them on their own. Finally, if there is an assignment attached to the training that's required for certification, leave your learners with meaningful choices and concrete steps they can take to be successful after the workshop ends. 

In the real world, things don’t always happen as we plan. Make sure your learners know where to go or who to contact if they need help when testing or using the new training in the wild. If it helps, point them to [our forum](https://forum.learning.mozilla.org/c/mozilla-clubs) to ask our global network of leaders or invite them to email teachtheweb@mozillafoundatin.org 

Debrief with facilitators and mentors as soon as possible following the event, even right after the event itself. Consider what went well, what might you change for next time, what immediate follow-up steps can you take. It’s usually a good idea to send a follow up email thanking participants for attending and/or include any relevant links or instructions for how to stay connected. In the debrief the team can identify what else to include in the follow up email and who will send it. 

OPTIONAL: End on a celebratory note. Some trainings allow opportunity to network, chat and reflect in an informal setting with facilitators and learners after the event has officially ended. You can also end on a celebratory note by taking a team picture or doing an activity as a group. Choose the right activity, if any, that makes sense in your local setting.

###Other tips:
*  Create a space for learners to introduce each other, engage and converse online. We like to use our community platform, Discourse. Set up a new thread for your event and share it with your learners at the beginning. Make sure you encourage them to participate in the thread either before, during or after the event. [Here’s an example from a past training.](https://discourse.webmaker.org/t/ippd-web-literacy-leaders/294) 
*  Always have your attendees at the core of your training. When planning for your training and it’s content make sure that is adjusted for the individuals who are attending. You want to make it relative to them and presented in a way that they feel comfortable adapting it afterwards. 
*  Consider how long your training will be. Most of our training events last 1-2 days which we have found is enough time to teach the fundamentals of Web Literacy to a variety of audiences. Make sure you aren’t rushing through activities or that you aren’t going at a pace too slow for your learners. Adapt your timing as you go and if you need to, break up your training into short sessions over a few days. If you don’t have much time, pick the most engaging and effective activities and teach them well at the pace you usually take with them.

Have fun and thank you for helping to train more leaders advancing the web as a global public resource for all.
