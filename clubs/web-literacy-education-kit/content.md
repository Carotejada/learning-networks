#Mozilla Web Literacy Education Kit

You may not know it, but Mozilla, whose mission is to maintain the Internet as a global, public resource for all, offers free and open educational resources to help you teach important digital skills to your learners. Our focus is on web literacy, which is to read, write, and participate on the open web, while also building 21st Century skills in communication, creativity, problem-solving and collaboration.

If you're looking for fun, hands-on activities (optimized for ages 13 and up but easily adaptable for the younger set too) with step-by-step tutorials, you will love our resources! The curriculum is tested among educators and volunteers around the world, and can be remixed to suit a variety of  learning environments. You can try some standalone activities in your classroom or afterschool program, or follow a complete module comprised of a scaffolded set of activities. 

Mozilla also created Thimble, an online, educational code editor and remixing tool for teaching HTML, CSS and other web skills.

As you scroll through this kit, we provide more details about these **free and easy-to-use resources for your immediate use to teach the web**. 

If you have any ideas or questions about these resources, please email us anytime at [teachtheweb@mozillafoundation.org](mailto:teachtheweb@mozillafoundation.org), tweet us [@MozTeach](https://twitter.com/mozteach), or post on our [community forum](https://discourse.webmaker.org/). 

##Web Literacy Map Overview

![Web Literacy Map](http://i.imgur.com/HHaOGub.png)

The interactive framework consists of the skills and competencies needed to be web literate, while also building 21st Century skills in communication, creativity, problem-solving and collaboration. **Read** is about how we explore and evaluate web content. **Write** outlines the skills needed to build and contribute to the Web. **Participate** refers to how we connect with others online. Each skill links to related activities and curriculum and will eventually be linked to credentials that individuals can earn for mastering these skills. 

We encourage you to sharpen your own skills and become a mentor in the community. Use the Web Literacy Map to plan learning activities for others. Reflect on this work in your own online spaces by blogging about it. Include the #teachtheweb and/or #webliteracy hashtags in your posts across social media to contribute to the dialogue. And join the Mozilla Learning [community calls](https://teach.mozilla.org/community/community-call) each month to engage and participate in practical discussions about web literacy.

##Curriculum Overview

Start teaching others how to read, write and participate on the web with **free activities created by teachers, educators and technologists like you**. Each teaching activity is fully scalable and remixable to meet your needs, and the needs of your participants. Many of the activities can be adapted offline, and also include activity guides, handouts, and other resources, as appropriate.

Here are a few of the teaching kits available. For a full list and access, please visit: [https://teach.mozilla.org/activities](https://teach.mozilla.org/activities/).

Here are some great examples of how these teaching kits are being used across the globe: 

* Learn how a **Mozilla Club in Switzerland** used [Kraken the Code](http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-curriculum/WebLiteracyBasics-I/session01-kraken.html) in their kick-off event [here](https://learningfreewheel.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/mozilla-club-lift-off/). And here’s a bit about what they did remixing with Thimble:
    Using [Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org/) we remixed a meme to explain our understanding. In [X-ray Goggles](https://webmaker.org/en-US/goggles) we explored remixing further by redesigning the [Science Museum, London](http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/) website to be all about the Kraken. This idea evolved from one of the many inspirations from Mozfest, London and a collaboration with Tate Gallery.
* A variety of Mozilla free resources were used for a **Maker Party in India**. [Read the details and view photos here](https://rowdymehul.wordpress.com/2015/08/05/maker-party-mega-nashik/).
* Active community member [Greg McVerry](https://twitter.com/jgmac1106) uses Thimble in his **University classroom** for his [student’s final projects](http://edu106.networkedlearningcollaborative.com/pages/fall15-portfolios).
* [This article](http://www.cilip.org.uk/blog/digital-literacy-maker-librarians-mozilla-learning-network) outlines how [**one librarian from the UK**](https://twitter.com/mrs_kapp), when speaking about the fundamental clash between youth and adults on the web... 
    “...shared her [Mozilla teaching kit](https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/mrskapp/9795/) [which she remixed herself!] and talked about how as a “maker librarian you are committing to providing an open space where students are free to make choices about their learning”. This was her take on “Embracing the 21st century chaos” that technology brought to her school's front door.”
* **In the U.S.A.**, the [National Writing Project](http://letters2president.org/resource/letters-to-the-next-president-2-0-letter-remix/) is featuring a [Letters to the Next President Thimble template](https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/chadsansing/24389/) to use in a national campaign for youth to write a letter to the next President.
