#Hosting a Mozilla Club in Your Library
Developed by: Kristina Gorr and the Mozilla Clubs team

>"At their best ... libraries serve as centers of discovery and communication–places where people gather and where information comes alive through teaching and personal interaction. Indeed, to distinguish themselves in a world where Google is well on its way to digitally scanning most of the books ever written, libraries are learning to take advantage of the simple fact that they are centrally located in almost every community. In other words, libraries now see success being linked to their role as public places and destinations.” - [Cynthia Nikitin and Josh Jackson of Project for Public Spaces](http://www.pps.org/reference/librariesthatmatter-2/)

##Why Should You Meet in a Library?

* 98.0% of libraries offer either formal or informal technology training to patrons
* 49.3% of libraries offer formal technology training classes in general computer use

[These statistics](http://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2014/07/libraries-support-digital-readiness-tech-training-stem-programs-more-robust) offer encouragement that a partnership between a Mozilla Club and library is a great match. 

###If you’re an individual wanting to host a club in your local library…..
Your Mozilla Club will see many benefits from hosting your meetings in a library, whether a public, post-secondary, or school library! Options available and meeting details will vary, so contact your local library staff to discuss how your club might fit. 

Library spaces are ideal for club meeting because they have a minimal rental fee (or might be free), are open to the community, and viewed as a safe space for community members of any age. The also offer ample internet connectivity, which is difficult to find in some communities. Because they are already community spaces, your regular library traffic will help to spread the word about your Club. Many libraries are equipped with small study spaces or meeting rooms, and may be open to larger events as well, making the library an ideal spot for a Club of any size. If your club meets regularly you can likely add your meeting to the library’s event calendar or distribute communication material throughout the library, spreading the word about your Club to the community even further for free. Contact your local library staff for options available for your club to meet in their space.

####How to start a your club in a library
Here are some quick steps to getting your club started at a library:

1. Connect with library staff to discuss your club needs and come to agreement on what is available and fits both your club requirements and library guidelines.
2. Pick a date and time that work for you and the library.
3. Circulate information about the club online and within the library space.
4. Have a designated area where your club takes place in the library and make sure the set-up is designed for group work (and perhaps some noise!). If you can run your club in a highly visible space, you might attract new mentors and participants, as well.
5. Find co-facilitators or mentors to join you. Consider running a training and event for volunteers before the actual event. [Here’s a guide on how to run a training.](http://mozilla.github.io/learning-networks/clubs/train-the-trainer-guide/) 
6. Create your agenda or pick some activities to run at [learning.mozilla.org](https://learning.mozilla.org/).

###If you’re a library wanting to start a Mozilla Club in your space…..
Libraries can benefit from running a Mozilla Club meeting in their space, as well.  Hosting local clubs and activities strengthens the resources available to the community, making the library a healthy, vibrant place for gatherings like clubs to promote web literacy. It’s essential for libraries to remain a positive place for youth and adults alike, especially as the digital age changes the environment of libraries across the world. Moreover, beginning a club can help spotlight your library’s digital programming for patrons, as well as attract local technology mentors to library-hosted events. Running a club is a way to connect learners and leaders in your library on a regular basis, establishing a strong mentorship offering with your library at the center.

####How to start a club in your library
Here are some quick steps to getting a club started at your library:

1. Conduct an assessment of programs that are already hosted in your library and determine if and how a Mozilla Club might complement them.
2. Decide on partners/patrons that might be interested in getting involved.
3. Plan and conduct a preview night to build up interest and finalize plans for an ongoing club meeting.
4. If you decide to move forward with the club, pick a recurring date and time that works for the library schedule.
5. Circulate information about the club online and within the library space.
6. Create your agenda or pick some activities to run at [learning.mozilla.org](https://learning.mozilla.org/).

##Facilitation Tips
Because you are hosting your Club in a public space, there are some best practice guidelines that you should abide by:

* You’re meeting in a common, public space, so be sure to respect it as such. 
* Always leave the space cleaner than when you found it.
* Move tables, chairs, and other furniture back to their original places if you rearranged them for your meeting.
* Be mindful of the noise level of your meetup. While you don’t need to whisper, monitor the noise level periodically, especially with youth. Check in with library staff, as well, regarding noise guidelines -  as more and more community programming moves into library spaces, silence isn’t always the rule in libraries.
* Post clear signage where your library permits that lists the name of your Club, the topic of meet-up, and the date, time, and location of your meeting.
* Be inclusive and welcoming to participants and curious bystanders who drop in to check out your club. Ask your regional coordinator or another mentor for help debiasing materials and make sure that all of your club members can see themselves in your lessons and materials. 
* Look into other meetups and events that are happening at the library. You may not want to host your meeting at the same time to minimize competition between programs. On the other hand, maybe you can collaborate with another program meeting at the same time!

###Guidelines for Libraries Hosting a Club
It’s important as the hosting library to be as clear as possible regarding expectations for clubs in your public space. The guidelines above in the “Facilitation Tips for Clubs in Libraries” can be a great place to start!
