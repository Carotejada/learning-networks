#Globally Increasing Women’s Web Literacy
Developed by: Kristina Verbo, Carolina Tejada Alvarez, Kristina Gorr and the Mozilla Clubs team

Let’s work together to create a Mozilla Club environment in which women will see technology in a whole new light – as a medium for self-expression, and as a means for changing the world. Encouraging women to see the value in web literacy, to regularly participate in your club, and to eventually #teachtheweb to others will transform global web literacy as we know it. Whether it is with your current club, or a new Mozilla Club designed for women, we can make great strides towards global web literacy by helping women feel welcome to engage in the web.

##Why is it important to focus on women?
The world has a history of suppressing women’s rights, opinions, education, community, and so much more. Every time a layer of that suppression is stripped away (usually thanks to a brave woman fighting the fight), a change for the better follows shortly after. If women are able to understand and participate on the web, as equally as men, we will untap a wealth of knowledge, ideas, and resources that will change the world. Let’s take a step in that direction with Mozilla Clubs!

##Facilitation Tips
When an assistant at a University opened an invitation for a Women’s Computer Science group, she didn’t expect many responses… but she got more than 50! She had to find a new place to run it because there were more participants interested than she was expecting. Web Literacy is a doorway to women empowerment and you can help facilitate women crossing through that threshold. Here are some tips to facilitate events with a predominantly female group:

* Provide the technical information, but always connect that with particular interests of your participants (the arts, for example). This is engaging and powerful, as it provides self-motivation to achieving their dreams/passions.
* If possible, inviting young women (as young as 15-18) to your group is effective, as they are still making directional life choices and creating their interests.
BUT, invite women of all ages! Just be mindful that they will have different web literacy needs and there must be different programs, curriculum and tools to guarantee the engagement for all. 
* Find out what they already know about the web and connect what they are already doing to help them understand. For example, if they are present on social media, you can dig deeper into a discussion asking, “What do you do on social media?”, “What are the consequences?”, “How can you read content critically?”, “How can you protect your privacy on social media?”, etc.
* Build confidence in women participants by creating a safe environment where there are no “stupid” questions, every mistake is viewed as an opportunity to learn, and allow them to work together to build relationships as much as possible. Create a safe environment by:
    * Setting ground rules. Tell participants to be respectful of others opinions, that information will remain confidential, and other relevant information that is needed. 
    * Asking and encouraging all individuals to participate. 
    * Be supportive of all opinions.
    * *Play a supporter role, not a micromanagement role. Share, learn, motivate, create together. Connect with other Mozilla Club Captains and share ideas

##Activity Ideas
There are tons of great activities that encourage learning on [learning.mozilla.org/activities](https://learning.mozilla.org/activities/). This list highlights a few to get you started. 

* Personal Presentation Icebreakers: Sit in a circle and...
    * Share your name & fun fact about you.
    * Share why increasing digital literacy for women and girls is important to you.
    * Share your goals for being in the Mozilla Club.
* Post-It Note Q&A/Discussions: Provide a prompt and have participants write answers/feedback on a post-it note, then stick it to a wall.
    * Prompt Ideas:
    * What does web literacy looks like in your community?
    * What does women empowerment looks like in your community?
    * What web literacy for women looks like in your community?
    * Are there any blockers in encouraging emerging leaders in solidifying Web Literacy for women?
    * Are there any existing programs with the same goals? How are they effective?
* Group Hack/Remix Challenges: Whatever tool or challenge you decide to use, remixing is a great way to connect the web with women’s passions and interests. Here are some remix ideas:

* Women-Focused Coding Activities:
    * [Gender in Tech - Hacking My Media](https://stephguthrie.makes.org/thimble/ODU3ODAxMjE2/hacking-my-media-with-x-ray-goggles): In this activity, learners create a remix of a Wikimedia page as they think critically about the intersection of gender, culture, technology and identity.
    * [Made With Code](https://learning.mozilla.org/activities/madewithcode/): Mozilla is happy to partner with Google's Made with Code initiative to inspire girls to get creative with code. There are three fun activities to help you create your own webpages by writing and remixing HTML.
