#Retaining, Growing Community Online & Off
Developed by: Nick Weinberg, Carolina Tejada Alvarez, Kristina Gorr and the Mozilla Clubs team

Building community is incredibly powerful, but as it grows it can become tricky. Once you’ve built a community, how can you build enough momentum to retain them and keep members active and engaged? Also, how can you continue to attract new, diverse and dedicated community members, while avoiding self-gentrification? This guide provides best practices and resources for retaining and growing your local community while also keeping them committed and participating. You’ll learn how to bridge the gap between the online and in person communities to ultimately build a SUPER community.

##What is community? 

A Mozilla Club community meets regularly in-person to learn how to read, write and participate on the Web in an inclusive, engaging way. This should be the definition of community that each Mozilla Club across the globe lives by. Ensuring that community does not shrink, or become stagnant is key.

##Facilitation Tips
Retaining and growing community is vital to the health and longevity of a successful Mozilla Club. There are many things you can do to help facilitate that kind of health and growth. Here are a few tips on how to do so:

* Communities and movements take strong leaders, but most importantly, they require even stronger followers. Based on what you know about your participants, encourage their strengths and help them to utilize them in your Club so they have a strong sense of community from the start.
* Every community faces challenges as they grow and evolve. To make sure your entire group (long-time participants and new members) feel welcome, comfortable, and in a safe learning environment, discuss and address challenges regularly.
  * Some common issues that you may be facing include: Community members participating less, difficult to get in-person participation, no desire/understanding of why sharing with others online is important, little to no collaboration,  self-gentrification (bringing in the same types of people). Keep an eye out for these and implement (and openly discuss) solution immediately. 
* Offer monthly challenges/program ideas and let the group vote on what to do next. This builds community, a sense of ownership, and will distribute the workload for planning (if others volunteer to help). 
  * Look for content that is adjustable and open enough that it can be interpreted and remixed in many different ways. [Here's an example](http://littlebits.cc/bitolympics).
* Partner with other Mozilla Clubs (or any other relevant club in your area). This is not only really fun and a great way to meet new people, your Club will see how others are leading and running groups and will be motivated to keep yours healthy, as well.
* Try out Community calls! On the last Wednesday of every month, invite your online community to join you for a video call. Line up a guest speaker for a short Q&A and then break down into individual video chat rooms to have more intimate conversations with other members of the community. You can try the open source MIT platform called [Unhangout](https://unhangout.media.mit.edu/), that uses Google Hangouts to create small breakout sessions as needed, and help users find others with shared interests. Invite well-known educators, thinkers, makers and tinkerers to join as well. THIS is where community members get to meet face-to-face and where collaboration starts to  happen naturally.
* Utilize Online forums. They exist as a place for community members to talk about what’s on their minds: project ideas, support, events, etc. These forums can indeed become stagnant if you don’t manage them properly, but try posting a weekly conversation starter and tagging community members you think might enjoy talking further about it. [Our community forum](https://forum.learning.mozilla.org) is an example of an online forum that you can participate in as a part of the global Mozilla Clubs community.
* Host local community meetups. Every couple months host a meet-up to bring together the local community. Hosting a meetup is easy and can be done in any type of a space: an apartment, backyard, coffee shop, bar, etc. At these meetups, offer plenty of time to network, but also offer guided discussion or a hands-on project. Collaboration is key!
  * [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) is an excellent tool to spread the word and a way to bring in new community members.

##Activity Ideas
There are tons of great activities that encourage community building, both online and offline at [learning.mozilla.org/activities](https://learning.mozilla.org/activities). Here are a few suggestions to collaborate with, retain and grow your Mozilla Club:

* Personal Presentation Icebreakers: Sit in a circle and...
  * Share your name & fun fact about you.
  * Who has inspired you within our Mozilla Club?
  * Why do you come back to this Mozilla Club meeting after meeting?
* Post-It Note Q&A/Discussions: Provide a prompt and have participants write answers/feedback on a post-it note, then stick it to a wall. Facilitate discussion afterwards.
  * Prompt Ideas:
    * What old or new issues is our Mozilla Club facing?
      * How do we address these issues?
    * What online tools do you use for collaboration?
    * What is your favorite online forum and why?
    * What ideas do you have to invite more people to our Club?
* Lo-Fi, No-Fi Activities: Learn to code with limited or no connectivity. It encourages teamwork, provides opportunity for great discussion, and can surface opportunities to build a stronger sense of community within your group dynamic. These can be especially fun when hosting a larger event that includes outside community members.
  * [Studio.code.org](https://studio.code.org/s/course2) offers many “unplugged” activities for those with no prior programming experience.
  * [Learning.mozilla.org](https://learning.mozilla.org/activities) offers 19 activities in this [lo-fi, no-fi teaching kit](https://laura.makes.org/thimble/MTUyODMwNDY0/lofi-nofi-teaching-kit).
* Group Hack/Remix Challenges: Whatever tool or challenge you decide to use, pair your participants into teams to work together to achieve a goal. Add a bit of playful competition between teams by adding time restrictions, small prizes, or bragging rights.
  * [Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org/) - [Interactive Postcard Remix](https://thimble.mozilla.org/anonymous/168ddc95-94a9-4680-b5cc-0727f62e1e84/75)
  * [Create a WebMaker Project](http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-curriculum/MobileWeb/create-webmaker-project.html)
  * [X-Ray Goggles](https://goggles.mozilla.org/) - [Hack the News activity](http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-curriculum/WebLiteracyBasics-I/session02-hackthenews.html)
