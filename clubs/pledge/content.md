#Mozilla Club Captain Pledge

I understand that:

A Mozilla Club is a unique and sustainable way to teach the Web. It focuses on regular, in-person meetings with learning tailored to the needs and opportunities of my local community. It harnesses the Web as a unique public resource to learn and grow. 

As a Mozilla Club Captain, I pledge to:

* Teach others how to read, write and participate on the Web using inclusive and participatory methods in safe and welcoming spaces. 
* Empower learners through authentic making, reflective learning, and meaningful action with and on the Web. 
* Commit to the mission of universal web literacy. 
* Share my club’s experience with Mozilla Learning Networks through participation in regular calls and discussion forums. 
* Honor Mozilla’s [community participation guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/), [style guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/), and [privacy policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/websites/).
