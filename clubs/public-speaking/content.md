#Public Speaking: Becoming comfortable with speaking in front of your Mozilla Club and Club partners
Developed by: Kristina Gorr and the Mozilla Clubs team

“It's much easier to be convincing if you care about your topic. Figure out what's important to you about your message and speak from the heart.”
― [Nicholas Boothman](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/105972.Nicholas_Boothman)

Public speaking is a great skill to develop and one that doesn’t come naturally to everyone. You may have terrible stage fright, don’t know what to say or how to say it, or simply don’t know how to captivate an audience. There are practical and easy ways to improve your public speaking abilities. This guide will explore:

* Preparation, introductions, and message best practices
* Tips that will improve your public speaking ability
* Guidelines for finding a mentor that can help 
* Resources to dive deeper as you sharpen your skill

Public speaking is scary for a lot of people, but it doesn’t have to be! If you practice and address the specific reasons why public speaking is scary for you, you can and will develop a highly valued and esteemed skill.

##Public Speaking Best Practices

###Things to keep in mind…

1. Have a clear plan for what you are going to say and why you are going to say it. If it’s not well thought out, it will show.
2. Look professional. This means that you need to be well-groomed, smell nice, and wear appropriate clothing.
3. Act professional. This means that before (and after) the event, you need to be courteous, kind, and friendly. What you have to say will lose credibility if your audience doesn’t have a good first (or last) impression of you.
4. Watch others who are master public speakers, take notes, and learn from the best. Just make sure they really are great at public speaking so you don’t pick up bad habits!

  a. [Mitchell Baker](https://air.mozilla.org/search/?q=mitchell+baker), Mozilla Executive Chairwoman, and [Mark Surman](https://marksurman.commons.ca/speaking-engagements/), Mozilla Foundation Executive Director, are great speakers to watch.
  
  b. [TED Talks](https://www.ted.com/talks) is a great place to find great public speakers to watch.
  
5. Figure out how to calm your nerves. What makes public speaking scary for you? Once you figure it out, learn how to control it. Taking deep breaths, using positive visualization (whatever makes you happy), and smiling are all exercises that work for many people.
  
  a. Need more ideas to help conquer your fear? [This article](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/tips-to-conquer-fear-of-public-speaking-2015-7) provides 7 science-backed strategies you can utilize to overcome your            struggle.

6. Figure out if you have a “whisker word” and work to stop using it, even in everyday conversations. 

  a. A whisker word is a word that you use to fill silence while you are thinking of what to say next. For many people, it is “um” or        “uh,” but can also be “so,” “therefore,” “and,” or even a phrase such as “you know.”

  b. To figure out if you have a whisker word, ask your friends if there is a particular word that you say often, especially when             speaking in front of a crowd. The word shows up more when you are nervous. Or, record yourself and listen for the word that keeps        popping up
  
  c. One method to stop whisker words: Put a rubberband around your wrist. Every time you catch yourself saying the word, give the rubber      band a light snap! You’ll notice the word and try to stop yourself from saying it rather quickly.
  
7. **Practice, practice, practice!** Practice makes perfect so the more opportunities you have to speak in front of a crowd, the better you will get. 

###Introductions

1. Start by introducing yourself and your role in clear, straightforward terms. Especially if this is first time many listeners are meeting you.

  e.g. “I’m Sam Smith, a Mozilla Representative and Mozilla Barcelona Club Captain. I’ve been with Mozilla for 3 years and became a Club Captain last June.”

2. Before delving into the event/meetings details, provide a brief, high-level explanation of objectives for the event/meeting.  

  e.g. “Mozilla Barcelona is dedicated to helping people learn the most important skills of our age: the ability to read, write and participate in the digital world. One way we’re doing that is by bringing together the community to learn and collaborate about various open web topics. Today we’re diving into privacy on the web.”

###Body of your message

1. Only use slides if you have powerful images. Action shots of people, or screenshots of your creation/web page in action are great. Do not use slides to host large bodies of text. 
2. Keep it short and simple. A great message is one that is concise, to-the-point, and doesn’t bore the audience. In fact:

  “You remember approximately 20 percent of what you hear. You remember approximately 30 percent of what you see. You remember approximately 50 percent of what you hear and see together. You remember approximately 70 percent of what you say (if you think as you are saying it).” - [Darmouth Active Study](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiYr9-Z99HLAhVNxWMKHYJ0BZoQFggeMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dartmouth.edu%2F~acskills%2Fdocs%2Fstudy_actively.doc&usg=AFQjCNGSXkIpWCMr03ik3EHMdHmjAUlFlQ)

 In other words, say what you need to say, using powerful visuals, then let your audience discuss or conduct an activity that solidifies the points you are trying to make for themselves. They will remember more of what they say and do on their own.

3. Don’t use your whisker word! (See #6 from “things to keep in mind…”)

###How to practice
Here are a few great tips from Mozilla’s [TechSpeakers Curriculum](https://wiki.mozilla.org/TechSpeakers/Curriculum):

* Step 1: Record Yourself.
  * Record 3-5 minutes of yourself presenting. Get feedback from your mentor/peers:
    * What's working about what I'm doing?
    * What would you like to see more of?
* Step 2: Re-record Yourself.
  * In light of feedback, re-record and resubmit to the same mentor/peers with the following question: Was that better?
* Step 3: Repeat until satisfied with the results!

##Choosing a Mentor
Because public speaking is a very public skill, it’s important to get feedback from someone you respect and trust regarding how you are doing with your public speaking progress. You want to choose someone that will give you constructive feedback that isn’t mean or belittling, but rather builds you up and encourages you to keep improving. Some people choose family members, close friends, or trusted work colleagues. It doesn’t matter who you choose, as long as you trust them to be honest, motivating, and will check in with your about your progress often.  

Once you’ve chosen who you’d like for the perfect mentor, ask them if they are interested in helping you. Be very clear with what and how you would like their help, and expectations you have for their feedback.

  “Hi Jane. I am looking for a mentor that can help me improve my public speaking skills and I think you would be perfect. Could you watch me practice and provide constructive feedback on what I am doing well and what I need to adjust? I know that you will be honest, helpful, and motivating which is why I think you are the perfect person for the job. Are you willing to help me?”
