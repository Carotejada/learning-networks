#Incorporating Mozilla Club content in your school curriculum

*Created by Kristina Gorr, Chad Sansing, Kim Wilkens, Greg McVerry, Gina Tesoriero and the Mozilla Clubs team*

*“Integrating technology into classroom instruction means more than teaching basic computer skills and software programs in a separate computer class. Effective tech integration must happen across the curriculum in ways that...deepen and enhance the learning process... active engagement, participation in groups, frequent interaction and feedback, and connection to real-world experts.”* -[Edutopia](http://www.edutopia.org/technology-integration-introduction)

It can be challenging to incorporate third party content in your existing school curriculum, but it doesn’t have to be! If you're looking for fun, hands-on activities (optimized for ages 13 and up but easily adaptable for the younger set too) with step-by-step tutorials, you will love Mozilla resources! The curriculum is tested among educators and volunteers around the world, and can be remixed to suit a variety of  learning environments. You can try some standalone activities in your classroom or afterschool program, or follow a complete module comprised of a scaffolded set of activities.

This guide will walk you through incorporating Mozilla’s online teaching tools and resources, including:

* List of remixable teaching resources
* Principles for successful curriculum integration 
* Tips from educators who have successfully incorporated Mozilla content
* Real life examples for using outside resources in your classroom

##Mozilla’s Remixable Teaching Resources

![Teaching Activities](http://i.imgur.com/QPFS3D3.png)

Start teaching others how to read, write and participate on the web with free activities created by teachers, educators and technologists like you. Each teaching activity is fully scalable and remixable to meet your needs, and the needs of your participants. Many of the activities can be adapted offline, and also include activity guides, handouts, and other resources, as appropriate.

Here are a few of the teaching kits available. For a full list and access, please visit: [https://learning.mozilla.org/activities](https://learning.mozilla.org/activities)

**Beginner**

* Web Literacy Basics I & II - Help learners become familiar with reading, writing and participating on the web by discovering the foundations of the web through production and collaboration.
* Privacy Basics: Passwords, Tracking, and Data Retention - Learn how to safeguard your privacy online and develop an awareness of how companies and governments track and collect your data online.
* Low to No Internet - This series of activities help teach web literacy concepts offline, or where access to technology is limited. Includes printable templates and games to teach coding, game design and app development.

**Intermediate**

* Intermediate Web Literacy I: Intro to CSS - Learn to style HTML elements on a webpage using CSS selectors, attributes, and values.
* Minecraft A Flavor of Java - Learners develop computational thinking skills by using Java to create their own Minecraft mod.
* Girls In Tech: Hacking My Media - Create a remix of a Wikimedia page and think critically about the intersection of gender, culture, technology and identity.

Mozilla also offers free tools to help you teach the web! Thimble is our fun, educational code editor and remixing tool for teaching HTML, CSS and other web skills. You can [start a project from scratch or remix a featured activity](https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-US/). Thimble is a powerful curriculum aid: educators can build and share projects and activities, and remix other educators’ ideas - the options are endless!

##Principles for Successful Integration

* Fail forward, fail fast, and fail often. Web literacy is often a new topic for teachers and students alike. It can be challenging to learn the concepts behind the web, as well as the technical skills needed to read, write, and participate there all. Don’t be afraid to to say, “I don’t know,” or to fix a “bug” in your understanding openly with your class. Model failure as an opportunity to learn and improve your work. That attitude will come in handy when it’s time to test and tweak web pages!
* Take your best guess at what will hook your students - then edit and adapt based on what you learn. Try adjusting the curriculum to deal with issues and topics that are relevant to your group. 
* The more you try collaborating and incorporating new resources and content, the more opportunities you’ll see for this in the future.
* Be prepared to identify challenges, talk openly about them, and troubleshoot. You won’t have the perfect lesson every time, but you’ll learn what works and what doesn’t from each experience.
* Making, not moving content/text/notes from one medium to another, should be the goal and the primary focus of the lesson.
* Mozilla curriculum is a remixable foundation. Over time, you want to build it to create more authentic and relevant experiences for kids in your content area, and across content areas.
* Success looks like spending 30 minutes to find an extra (or missing) angle bracket - expect to move slowly, in small ways.

- You often don't have to start from scratch. For me, my goal has been to integrate Computer Science/web literacy concepts into the curriculum and classroom. That means working with subject/homeroom teachers and they don't have time for new content.
- Find out what kind of lessons/projects have been done with students in the past. Then, start with one lesson/project to “enhance”. 
- Brainstorm with other teachers about how your lessons/projects can be “enhanced”? For example: 
  - Could the lesson be more interactive? 
  - Could student creations offer an alternative vehicle for assessment? 
  - Could exploring more of the technology functionality give students more context and deeper understanding the subject?
- Create a framework for student work, while giving them creative freedom within it. 
- Create a rubric to guide students.
- Creating quick screencasts to go along with the lesson is super helpful for students and teachers new to web literacy.
- If you get stuck, ask the #teachtheweb community for ideas & suggestions.

##Real Life Examples from Across the Globe
Here are some great examples of how Mozilla teaching kits are being used across the globe:

* Learn how a Mozilla Club in Switzerland (MakerJam) used [Kraken the Code](http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-curriculum/WebLiteracyBasics-I/session01-kraken.html) in their kick-off event [here](https://learningfreewheel.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/mozilla-club-lift-off/). And here’s a bit about what they did remixing with Thimble:

    *Using [Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org/) we remixed a meme to explain our understanding. In [X-ray Goggles](https://goggles.mozilla.org/) we explored remixing further by redesigning the [Science Museum](http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/), London website to be all about the Kraken. This idea evolved from one of the many inspirations from Mozfest, London and a collaboration with Tate Gallery... Using the PingKong resources from Mozilla Learning we discovered how the internet works. Check out how students explained their understanding below:*

* Active community member [Greg McVerry](https://twitter.com/jgmac1106  ) uses Thimble in his University classroom for his [student’s final projects](http://edu106.networkedlearningcollaborative.com/pages/fall15-portfolios).
* In the U.S.A., the [National Writing Project](http://letters2president.org/resource/letters-to-the-next-president-2-0-letter-remix/) is featuring a [Letters to the Next President](https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/chadsansing/24389/) Thimble template to use in a national campaign for youth to write a letter to the next President. In the classroom, students across the nation are remixing this letter to learn about civic engagement.
* [Here is a great example](https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/sa501428/24680/) of a website built inside Thimble by a middle school student in Houston, Texas.
* [This roundup](https://blog.webmaker.org/our-creative-community-thimble-remixes) includes several fun and educational Thimble remixes from community members around the globe.
* [Here’s how](https://thimbleprojects.org/techkim/80727/) [Kim Wilkens](https://twitter.com/kimxtom) teaches HTML & CSS in her classroom.
* Kim also uses this [remixed “Three things I Love” project](https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/techkim/17428) for her 7th grade science projects.
* New York City teacher [Gina Tesoriero](https://twitter.com/MsTesoriero) personalized Mozilla’s [Kraken the Code](https://mozilla.github.io/mozilla-club-activity-kraken-the-code/#en) activity for her classroom. [See her remix here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c6IUnu1BQ0f1NN_Z7ih_MtTAvtgbUJjU9zFvFOjHSfQ/edit#slide=id.g6d6bb3d72_09).
  * Gina also made this Thimble [starter sheet](https://drive.google.com/a/mozillafoundation.org/file/d/0B3GjBVDdZ46_dmNYaHpjUTA4RTQ/view) for her students to help get them started with coding their own [comic strip remix](https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-US/anonymous/56f7a64b-7210-44b6-9f39-680fb6b7f302/74).

*“My class had to meet strict objectives for our tech fluency requirements. I wanted to focus on the Web Literacy Map. So I looked for correlations. How could I meet my required pedagogical goals while preparing students to read, write and participate on the web? That was the pedagogical choice that informed all iterations.”*

##More remix ideas (by subject)

Here are some examples to get your creativity flowing in specific education area.

**English:**

* Have students summarize a novel or identify its key plot points by creating a web-native Choose your own adventure (CYOA) story with JavaScript or an online tool like Twine.
* Have students create review games about the revision process using a CYOA story.
* Have students create a CYOA story about empathy for a character in narrative non-fiction by presenting their decisions to readers/players.

**Science:**

* Review the scientific method or design/engineering process w/ a CYOA story with JavaScript or an online tool like Twine.
* Have students write a CYOA story about a highly reactive atom or molecule deciding where to bond with another.

**History:**

* Using Thimble, create a page for an historical figure - a biography, a 1st person social media page, a “Did you know” page, etc.
* Create history trivia flashcards using a project like our flipped postcard.

**Math:**

* Using Thimble, create different shapes - or “box models” - out of CSS and HTML using pixel measurement. Then figure out their dimensions and areas in “px.”
* Use percentages to size different elements on a webpage in Thimble and explore the ratios and relationships between them visually online.
* Work with rgb (red, green, blue) color values on a webpage. Each color has 256 “steps” or possible values from 0 to 255. See how the webpage’s color changes when you manipulate those values in different mathematical ways.

**Art:**

* Create an [art gallery using Thimble](https://d157rqmxrxj6ey.cloudfront.net/techkim/41376/index.html) to showcase student’s work.
* Animation is art too! Try out this [teaching kit](https://learning.mozilla.org/activities/parapara/) where students learn to use Mozilla Factory’s Parapara and Fabble, open web tools for animation and sharing work online. Create 2D animations, 3D projection-mapped animations, and ‘recipes’ that others can fork for remix on Fabble.

> **Advice from #teachtheweb advocate & educator [Gina Tesoriero](https://twitter.com/MsTesoriero)**
“When students need help:
- Identify mentor students that can help other students as they encounter obstacles. 
- Have a fun way for students to ask for help without raising their hand so they can be productive while they are waiting. Flipping a cup over or wearing a silly hat, for example. And make sure they have something to do while they are waiting. 
- Try the "[ask 3 before me](https://www.teachingchannel.org/videos/ask-3-then-me)" technique to encourage collaboration and discovery learning.”
