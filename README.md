# Welcome!

This repo is for tracking initiatives of the Mozilla Learning Networks team.

### Adding new pages via the drag & drop!

1. Download the [Template Folder zip file](https://github.com/mozilla/learning-networks/releases/download/1/clubs-blank-template.zip)
2. Unzip it
3. Edit the ``content.md`` file only
  * Try the [Brackets Editor](http://brackets.io/) - it's cool!
  * It's in markdown, here's a [handy syntax guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
4. Rename the folder to match the content title, this will be a part of the URL so...
  * Make it all lowercase
  * Don't use special characters
  * Replace spaces with dashes (like-this)
5. Drag and drop the finished folder into the ``clubs`` folder on the ``gh-pages`` branch - [Right Here](https://github.com/mozilla/learning-networks/tree/gh-pages/clubs).
6. Your new page will be available at ``http://mozilla.github.io/learning-networks/clubs/name-of-your-folder``

Here is a handy **[Markdown Guide](http://mozilla.github.io/learning-networks/clubs/markdown-guide/)** to help you with formatting your content.

### Editing existing pages

##### If you already have the  folder & files on your computer
1. Edit the ``content.md`` file on your computer and save it.
2. Drag the folder into the ``clubs`` folder (just like outlined above).
3. **Warning** - your content will totally override what is in the repo
4. Basic syntax guide https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

##### If it is not
1. Navigate to the ``content.md`` file you want to edit in the Github UI
2. Click the Pencil icon near the top right of the file contents
3. Use the **Preview** tab to check your changes.
4. When you're ready, click the **Comitt** button to save your changes

### Changing the name of the folder
Unfortunately, you can't do this within the Github UI, so you'll have to upload another folder with the correct name.
* You can delete the original folder by using the Github UI to delete the files within in (see below)

### Deleting Pages
1. Navigate to the specific file you want to delete
2. Click the **Trash** icon in the top right of the file content
3. If you delete both files in the folder, the folder will be deleted automatically
